<span class="ch1">CHAPTER <abbr title="1">I.</abbr></span><br />

<span class="ch2">ARCHBISHOP THOMAS.</span><br />

<span class="ch3">1162–1164.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Somewhat</span> more than a year after the primate’s death,
Thomas the chancellor returned to England. He came, as
we have seen, at the king’s bidding, ostensibly for the
purpose of securing the recognition of little Henry as heir
to the crown. But this was not the sole nor even the chief
object of his mission. On the eve of his departure—so the
story was told by his friends in later days—Thomas had
gone to take leave of the king at Falaise. Henry drew
him aside: “You do not yet know to what you are going.
I will have you to be archbishop of Canterbury.” The
chancellor took, or tried to take, the words for a jest. “A
saintly figure indeed,” he exclaimed with a smiling glance at
his own gay attire, “you are choosing to sit in that holy
seat and to head that venerable convent! No, no,” he
added with sudden earnestness, “I warn you that if such
a thing should be, our friendship would soon turn to bitter
hate. I know your plans concerning the Church; you will
assert claims which I as archbishop must needs oppose; and
the breach once made, jealous hands would take care that it
should never be healed again.” The words were prophetic;
they sum up the whole history of the pontificate of Thomas
Becket. Henry, however, in his turn passed them over as
a mere jest, and at once proclaimed his intention to the
chancellor’s fellow-envoys, one of whom was the justiciar,
Richard de Lucy. “Richard,” said the king, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">ii.2</a></span>“if I lay dead
in my shroud, would you earnestly strive to secure my first-born
on my throne?” “Indeed I would, my lord, with all
my might.” “Then I charge you to strive no less earnestly
to place my chancellor on the metropolitan chair of Canterbury.”<a id="Anchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a></p>

<p>Thomas was appalled. He could not be altogether
taken by surprise; he knew what had been Theobald’s
wishes and hopes; he knew that from the moment of
Theobald’s death all eyes had turned instinctively upon
himself with the belief that the future of the Church rested
wholly in his all-powerful hands; he could not but suspect
the king’s own intentions,<a id="Anchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a> although the very suspicion would
keep him silent, and all the more so because those intentions
ran counter to his own desires. For twelve months he had
known that the primacy was within his reach; he had
counted the cost, and he had no mind to pay it. He was
incapable of undertaking any office without throwing his
whole energies into the fulfilment of its duties; his conception
of the duties of the primate of all Britain would
involve the sacrifice not only of those secular pursuits which
he so keenly enjoyed, but also of that personal friendship
and political co-operation with the king which seemed almost
an indispensable part of the life of both; and neither sacrifice
was he disposed to make. He had said as much to an
English friend who had been the first to hint at his coming
promotion,<a id="Anchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a> and he repeated it now with passionate earnestness
to Henry himself, but all in vain. The more he resisted,
the more the king insisted—the very frankness of his warnings
only strengthening Henry’s confidence in him; and
when the legate Cardinal Henry of Pisa urged his acceptance
as a sacred duty, Thomas at last gave way.<a id="Anchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a></p>

<p>The council in London was no sooner ended than Richard
de Lucy and three of the bishops<a id="Anchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">[5]</a> hurried to Canterbury, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">ii.3</a></span>
the king’s orders, to obtain from the cathedral chapter the
election of a primate in accordance with his will. The
monks of Christ Church were never very easy to manage;
in the days of the elder King Henry they had firmly and
successfully resisted the intrusion of a secular clerk into the
monastic chair of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Augustine; and a strong party among
them now protested that to choose for pastor of the flock of
Canterbury a man who was scarcely a clerk at all, who was
wholly given to hawks and hounds and the worldly ways of
the court, would be no better than setting a wolf to guard
a sheepfold. But their scruples were silenced by the arguments
of Richard de Lucy and by their dread of the royal
wrath, and in the end Thomas was elected without a dissentient
voice.<a id="Anchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a> The election was repeated in the presence
of a great council<a id="Anchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a> held at Westminster on May 23,<a id="Anchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a> and
ratified by the bishops and clergy there assembled.<a id="Anchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9.">[9]</a> Only
one voice was raised in protest; it was that of Gilbert Foliot,<a id="Anchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[10]</a>
who, alluding doubtless to the great scutage, declared that
Thomas was utterly unfit for the primacy, because he had
persecuted the Church of God.<a id="Anchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">[11]</a> The protest was answered
by Henry of Winchester in words suggested by Gilbert’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">ii.4</a></span>
own phrase: “My son,” said the ex-legate, addressing
Thomas, “if thou hast been hitherto as Saul the persecutor,
be thou henceforth as Paul the Apostle.”<a id="Anchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 12.">[12]</a></p>

<p>The election was confirmed by the great officers of state
and the boy-king in his father’s name;<a id="Anchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">[13]</a> the consecration
was fixed for the octave of Pentecost, and forthwith the
bishops began to vie with each other for the honour of performing
the ceremony. Roger of York, who till now had
stood completely aloof, claimed it as a privilege due to the
dignity of his see; but the primate-elect and the southern
bishops declined to accept his services without a profession
of canonical obedience to Canterbury, which he indignantly
refused.<a id="Anchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14.">[14]</a> The bishop of London, on whom as dean of the

put in a claim to supply his place,<a id="Anchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 16.">[16]</a> but withdrew it in
deference to Henry of Winchester, who had lately returned
from Cluny, and whose royal blood, venerable character, and
unique dignity as father of the whole English episcopate,
marked him out beyond all question as the most fitting
person to undertake the office.<a id="Anchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">[17]</a> By way of compensation,
it was Walter who, on the Saturday in Whitsun-week,

There was another claimant, a Welsh bishop, who asserted priority of consecration over all
his brother-prelates; so at least says <abbr title="Gervase of Canterbury">Gerv. Cant.</abbr>, but one does not see who he

<p>Early next morning the consecration took place. Canterbury
cathedral has been rebuilt from end to end since
that day; it is only imagination which can picture the
church of Lanfranc and Anselm and Theobald as it stood
on that June morning, the scarce-risen sun gleaming faintly
through its eastern windows upon the rich vestures of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">ii.5</a></span>
fourteen bishops<a id="Anchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 19.">[19]</a> and their attendant clergy and the dark robes
of the monks who thronged the choir, while the nave was
crowded with spectators, foremost among whom stood the
group of ministers surrounding the little king.<a id="Anchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 20.">[20]</a> From the
vestry-door Thomas came forth, clad no longer in the brilliant
attire at which he had been jesting a few weeks ago, but in the
plain black cassock and white surplice of a clerk; through the
lines of staring, wondering faces he passed into the choir,
and there threw himself prostrate upon the altar-steps.
Thence he was raised to go through a formality suggested
by the prudence of his consecrator. To guard, as he hoped,
against all risk of future difficulties which might arise from
Thomas’s connexion with the court, Henry of Winchester
led him down to the entrance of the choir, and in the name
of the Church called upon the king’s representatives to
deliver over the primate-elect fully and unreservedly to her
holy service, freed from all secular obligations, actual or
possible. A formal quit-claim was accordingly granted to
Thomas by little Henry and the justiciars, in the king’s
name;<a id="Anchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 21.">[21]</a> after which the bishop of Winchester proceeded to
consecrate him at once. A shout of applause rang through
the church as the new primate of all Britain was led up to
his patriarchal chair; but he mounted its steps with eyes
downcast and full of tears.<a id="Anchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 22.">[22]</a> To him the day was one of
melancholy foreboding; yet he made its memory joyful in
the Church for ever. He began his archiepiscopal career by
ordaining a new festival to be kept every year on that day—the
octave of Pentecost—in honour of the most Holy
Trinity;<a id="Anchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 23.">[23]</a> and in process of time the observance thus originated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">ii.6</a></span>
spread from Canterbury throughout the whole of
Christendom, which thus owes to an English archbishop the
institution of Trinity Sunday.</p>

<p>“The king has wrought a miracle,” sneered the sarcastic
bishop of Hereford, Gilbert Foliot; “out of a soldier and
man of the world he has made an archbishop.”<a id="Anchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 24.">[24]</a> The same
royal power helped to smooth the new primate’s path a little
further before him. He was not, like most of his predecessors,
obliged to go in person to fetch his pallium from
Rome; an embassy which he despatched immediately after
his consecration obtained it for him without difficulty from
Alexander <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>, who had just been driven by the Emperor’s
hostility to seek a refuge in France, and was in no condition
to venture upon any risk of thwarting King Henry’s favourite
minister.<a id="Anchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 25.">[25]</a> The next messenger whom Thomas sent over
sea met with a less pleasant reception. He was charged to
deliver up the great seal into the king’s hands with a request
that Henry would provide himself with another chancellor,
“as Thomas felt scarcely equal to the cares of one office,
far less to those of two.”<a id="Anchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 26.">[26]</a></p>

<p>Henry was both surprised and vexed. It was customary
for the chancellor to resign his office on promotion to a
bishopric; but this sudden step on the part of Thomas was
quite unexpected, and upset a cherished scheme of the
king’s. He had planned to rival the Emperor by having
an archbishop for his chancellor, as the archbishops of
Mainz and Cöln were respectively arch-chancellors of Germany

persisted in his resignation; and as there was no one

remained vacant, while the king brooded over his friend’s

by weariness of his service.</p>

The real work of the office in the

Reginald, of whom we shall hear again later on. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cancellarius</span>” plays almost

<p>Meanwhile Thomas had entered upon the second phase
of his strangely varied career. He had “put off the deacon”
for awhile; he was resolved now to “put off the old man”
wholly and for ever. No sooner was he consecrated than
he flung himself, body and soul, into his new life with an
ardour more passionate, more absorbing, more exclusive than
he had displayed in pursuit of the worldly tasks and pleasures
of the court. On the morrow of his consecration, when
some jongleurs came to him for the largesse which he had
never been known to refuse, he gently but firmly dismissed
them; he was no longer, he said, the chancellor whom they
had known; his whole possessions were now a sacred trust, to
be spent not on actors and jesters but in the service of the
Church and the poor.<a id="Anchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 30.">[30]</a> Theobald had doubled the amount
of regular alms-givings established by his predecessors;
Thomas immediately doubled those of Theobald.<a id="Anchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 31.">[31]</a> To be
diligent in providing for the sick and needy, to take care
that no beggar should ever be sent empty away from his
door,<a id="Anchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 32.">[32]</a> was indeed nothing new in the son of the good dame
Rohesia of Caen. The lavish hospitality of the chancellor’s
household, too, was naturally transferred to that of the archbishop;
but it took a different tone and colour. All and
more than all the old grandeur and orderliness were there;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">ii.8</a></span>
the palace still swarmed with men-at-arms, servants and
retainers of all kinds, every one with his own appointed
duty, whose fulfilment was still carefully watched by the
master’s eyes; the bevy of high-born children had only increased,
for by an ancient custom the second son of a baron
could be claimed by the primate for his service—as the
eldest by the king—until the age of knighthood; a claim
which Thomas was not slow to enforce, and which the barons
were delighted to admit. The train of clerks was of course
more numerous than ever. The tables were still laden with
delicate viands, served with the utmost perfection, and
crowded with guests of all ranks; Thomas was still the
most courteous and gracious of hosts. But the banquet
wore a graver aspect than in the chancellor’s hall. The
knights and other laymen occupied a table by themselves,
where they talked and laughed as they listed; it was the
clerks and religious who now sat nearest to Thomas. He
himself was surrounded by a select group of clerks, his
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eruditi</i>, his “learned men” as he called them: men versed
in Scriptural and theological lore, his chosen companions in
the study of Holy Writ into which he had plunged with
characteristic energy; while instead of the minstrelsy which
had been wont to accompany and inspire the gay talk at the
chancellor’s table, there was only heard, according to ecclesiastical
custom, the voice of the archbishop’s cross-bearer who
sat close to his side reading from some holy book: the
primate and his confidential companions meanwhile exchanging
comments upon what was read, and discussing matters
too deep and solemn to interest unlearned ears or to brook
unlearned interruption.<a id="Anchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 33.">[33]</a> Of the meal itself Thomas partook
but sparingly;<a id="Anchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 34.">[34]</a> its remainder was always given away;<a id="Anchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 35.">[35]</a> and
every day twenty-six poor men were brought into the hall
and served with a dinner of the best, before Thomas would
sit down to his own midday meal.<a id="Anchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 36.">[36]</a></p>

<p>The amount of work which he had got through by that
time must have been quite as great as in the busiest days of
his chancellorship. The day’s occupations ostensibly began
about the hour of tierce, when the archbishop came forth
from his chamber and went either to hear or to celebrate
mass,<a id="Anchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 37.">[37]</a> while a breakfast was given at his expense to a
hundred persons who were called his “poor prebendaries.”<a id="Anchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 38.">[38]</a>
After mass he proceeded to his audience-chamber and there
chiefly remained till the hour of nones, occupied in hearing suits
and administering justice.<a id="Anchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 39.">[39]</a> Nones were followed by dinner,<a id="Anchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 40.">[40]</a>
after which the primate shut himself up in his own apartments
with his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eruditi</i><a id="Anchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 41.">[41]</a> and spent the rest of the day with
them in business or study, interrupted only by the religious
duties of the canonical hours, and sometimes by a little
needful repose,<a id="Anchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 42.">[42]</a> for his night’s rest was of the briefest. At
cock-crow he rose for prime; immediately afterwards there
were brought in to him secretly, under cover of the darkness,
thirteen poor persons whose feet he washed and to whom he
ministered at table with the utmost devotion and humility,<a id="Anchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 43.">[43]</a>
clad only in a hair-shirt which from the day of his consecration
he always wore beneath the gorgeous robes in which
he appeared in public.<a id="Anchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 44.">[44]</a> He then returned to his bed, but
only for a very short time; long before any one else was astir
he was again up and doing, in company with one specially
favoured disciple—the one who tells the tale, Herbert of
Bosham. In the calm silent hours of dawn, while twelve
other poor persons received a secret meal and had their feet
washed by the primate’s almoner in his stead, the two friends
sat eagerly searching the Scriptures together, till the archbishop
chose to be left alone<a id="Anchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 45.">[45]</a> for meditation and confession,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">ii.10</a></span>
scourging and prayer,<a id="Anchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 46.">[46]</a> in which he remained absorbed until
the hour of tierce called him forth to his duties in the
world.<a id="Anchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 47.">[47]</a></p>

<p>He was feverishly anxious to lose no opportunity of
making up for his long neglect of the Scriptural and theological
studies befitting his sacred calling. He openly confessed
his grievous inferiority in this respect to many of his
own clerks, and put himself under their teaching with child-like
simplicity and earnestness. The one whom he specially
chose for monitor and guide, Herbert of Bosham, was a man
in whom, despite his immeasurable inferiority, one can yet
see something of a temper sufficiently akin to that of Thomas
himself to account for their mutual attraction, and perhaps
for some of their joint errors. As they rode from London
to Canterbury on the morrow of the primate’s election
he had drawn Herbert aside and laid upon him a special
charge to watch with careful eyes over his conduct as archbishop,
and tell him without stint or scruple whatever he saw
amiss in it or heard criticized by others.<a id="Anchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 48.">[48]</a> Herbert, though
he worshipped his primate with a perfect hero-worship, never
hesitated to fulfil this injunction to the letter as far as his
lights would permit; but unluckily his zeal was even less
tempered by discretion than that of Thomas himself. He
was a far less safe guide in the practical affairs of life than in
the intricate paths of abstract and mystical interpretation of
Holy Writ in which he and Thomas delighted to roam
together. Often, when no other quiet time could be found,
the archbishop would turn his horse aside as they travelled
along the road, beckon to his friend, draw out a book from
its hiding-place in one of his wide sleeves, and plunge into
an eager discussion of its contents as they ambled slowly
on.<a id="Anchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 49.">[49]</a> When at Canterbury, his greatest pleasure was to
betake himself to the cloister and sit reading like a lowly
monk in one of its quiet nooks.<a id="Anchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 50.">[50]</a></p>

<p>But the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eruditi</i> of Thomas, like the disciples of Theobald,
were the confidants and the sharers of far more than his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">ii.11</a></span>
literary and doctrinal studies. It was in those evening
hours which he spent in their midst, secluded from all outside
interruption, that the plans of Church reform and Church
revival, sketched long ago by other hands in the <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia
Theobaldi</i></cite>, assumed a shape which might perhaps have
startled Theobald himself. As the weeks wore quickly away
from Trinity to Ember-tide, the new primate set himself to
grapple at once with the ecclesiastical abuses of the time in
the persons of his first candidates for ordination. On his
theory the remedy for these abuses lay in the hands of the
bishops, and especially of the metropolitans, who fostered
simony, worldliness and immorality among the clergy by the
facility with which they admitted unqualified persons into
high orders, thus filling the ranks of the priesthood with
unworthy, ignorant and needy clerks, who either traded upon
their sacred profession as a means to secular advancement,
or disgraced it by the idle wanderings and unbecoming shifts
to which the lack of fit employment drove them to resort for
a living. He was determined that no favour or persuasion
should ever induce him to ordain any man whom he did not
know to be of saintly life and ample learning, and provided
with a benefice sufficient to furnish him with occupation
and maintenance; and he proclaimed and acted upon his
determination with the zeal of one who, as he openly avowed,
felt that he was himself the most glaring example of the
evils resulting from a less stringent system of discipline.<a id="Anchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 51.">[51]</a></p>

<p>His next undertaking was one which almost every new-made
prelate in any degree alive to the rights and duties of
his office found it needful to begin as soon as possible: the
recovery of the alienated property of his see. Gilbert Foliot,
the model English bishop of the day, had no sooner been
consecrated than he wrote to beg the Pope’s support in this
important and troublesome matter.<a id="Anchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 52.">[52]</a> It may well be that
even fourteen years later the metropolitan see had not yet
received full restitution for the spoliations of the anarchy.
Thomas however set to work in the most sweeping fashion,
boldly laying claim to every estate which he could find to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">ii.12</a></span>
have been granted away by his predecessors on grounds
which did not satisfy his exalted ideas of ecclesiastical right,
or on terms which he held detrimental to the interest and
dignity of his church, and enforcing his claims without
respect of persons; summarily turning out those who held
the archiepiscopal manors in ferm,<a id="Anchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 53.">[53]</a> disputing with the earl
of Clare for jurisdiction over the castle and district of Tunbridge,
and reclaiming, on the strength of a charter of the
Conqueror, the custody of Rochester castle from the Crown
itself. Such a course naturally stirred up for him a crowd
of enemies, and increased the jealousy, suspicion and resentment
which his new position and altered mode of life had
already excited among the companions and rivals of his
earlier days. The archbishop however was still, like the
chancellor, protected against them by the shield of the royal
favour; they could only work against him by working upon
the mind of Henry. One by one they carried over sea their
complaints of the wrongs which they had suffered, or with
which they were threatened, at the primate’s hands;<a id="Anchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 54.">[54]</a> they
reported all his daily doings and interpreted them in the
worst sense<span class="nobreak">:—</span>his strictness of life was superstition, his zeal
for justice was cruelty, his care for his church avarice, his
pontifical splendour pride, his vigour rashness and self-conceit:<a id="Anchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 55.">[55]</a>—if
the king did not look to it speedily, he would find his
laws and constitutions set at naught, his regal dignity
trodden under foot, and himself and his heirs reduced to mere
cyphers dependent on the will and pleasure of the archbishop
of Canterbury.<a id="Anchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 56.">[56]</a></p>

<p>At the close of the year Henry determined to go and
see for himself the truth of these strange rumours.<a id="Anchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 57.">[57]</a> The
negotiations concerning the papal question had detained him
on the continent throughout the summer; in the end both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">ii.13</a></span>
he and Louis gave a cordial welcome to Alexander, and a
general pacification was effected in a meeting of the two
kings and the Pope which took place late in the autumn at
Chouzy on the Loire. Compelled by contrary winds to
keep Christmas at Cherbourg instead of in England as he
had hoped,<a id="Anchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 58.">[58]</a> the king landed at Southampton on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Paul’s
day.<a id="Anchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 59.">[59]</a> Thomas, still accompanied by the little Henry, was
waiting to receive him; the two friends met with demonstrations
of the warmest affection, and travelled to London
together in the old intimate association.<a id="Anchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 60.">[60]</a> One subject of
disagreement indeed there was; Thomas had actually been
holding for six months the archdeaconry of Canterbury
together with the archbishopric, and this Henry, after several
vain remonstrances, now compelled him to resign.<a id="Anchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 61.">[61]</a> They
parted however in undisturbed harmony, the archbishop

<p>The first joint work of king and primate was the translation
of Gilbert Foliot from Hereford to London. Some of
those who saw its consequences in after-days declared that
Henry had devised the scheme for the special purpose of
securing Gilbert’s aid against the primate;<a id="Anchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 63.">[63]</a> but it is abundantly
clear that no such thought had yet entered his mind,
and that the suggestion of Gilbert’s promotion really came
from Thomas himself.<a id="Anchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 64.">[64]</a> Like every one else, he looked upon
Gilbert as the greatest living light of the English Church;
he expected to find in him his own most zealous and efficient
fellow-worker in the task which lay before him as metropolitan,
as well as his best helper in influencing the king for
good. Gilbert was in fact the man who in the natural
fitness of things had seemed marked out for the primacy;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">ii.14</a></span>
failing that, it was almost a matter of necessity that he
should be placed in the see which stood next in dignity, and
where both king and primate could benefit by his assistance
ever at hand, instead of having to seek out their most useful
adviser in the troubled depths of the Welsh marches. The
chapter of London, to whom during the pecuniary troubles
and long illness of their late bishop Gilbert had been an
invaluable friend and protector, were only too glad to elect
him; and his world-wide reputation combined with the
pleadings of Henry to obtain the Pope’s consent to his
translation,<a id="Anchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 65.">[65]</a> which was completed by his enthronement in
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Paul’s cathedral on April 28, 1163.<a id="Anchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 66.">[66]</a></p>

<p>The king spent the early summer in subduing South-Wales;
the primate, in attending a council held by Pope
Alexander at Tours.<a id="Anchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 67.">[67]</a> From the day of his departure to
that of his return Thomas’s journey was one long triumphal
progress; Pope and cardinals welcomed him with such
honours as had never been given to any former archbishop
of Canterbury, hardly even to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Anselm himself;<a id="Anchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 68.">[68]</a> and the
request which he made to the Pope for Anselm’s canonization<a id="Anchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 69.">[69]</a>
may indicate the effect which they produced on his
mind—confirming his resolve to stand boldly upon his right
of opposition to the secular power whenever it clashed with
ecclesiastical theories of liberty and justice. The first
opportunity for putting his resolve in practice arose upon
a question of purely temporal administration at a council
held by Henry at Woodstock on July 31, after his return
from Wales. The Welsh princes came to swear fealty to
Henry and his heir; Malcolm of Scotland came to confirm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">ii.15</a></span>
his alliance with the English Crown by doing homage in
like manner to the little king.<a id="Anchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 70.">[70]</a> Before the council broke
up, however, Henry met the sharpest constitutional defeat
which had befallen any English sovereign since the Norman
conquest, and that at the hands of his own familiar friend.</p>

<p>The king had devised a new financial project for increasing
his own revenue at the expense of the sheriffs.
According to current practice, a sum of two shillings annually
from every hide of land in the shire was paid to those officers
for their services to the community in its administration and
defence. This payment, although described as customary
rather than legal,<a id="Anchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 71.">[71]</a> and called the “sheriff’s aid,”<a id="Anchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 72.">[72]</a> seems
really to have been nothing else than the Danegeld, which
still occasionally made its appearance in the treasury rolls,
but in such small amount that it is evident the sheriffs, if
they collected it in full, paid only a fixed composition to the
Crown and kept the greater part as a remuneration for their
own labours. Henry now, it seems, proposed to transfer the
whole of these sums from the sheriff’s income to his own,
and have it enrolled in full among the royal dues. Whether
he intended to make compensation to the sheriffs from some
other source, or whether he already saw the need of curbing
their influence and checking their avarice, we know not; but
the archbishop of Canterbury started up to resist the proposed
change as an injustice both to the receivers and to the
payers of the aid. He seems to have looked upon it as an
attempt to re-establish the Danegeld with all the odiousness
attaching to its shameful origin and its unfair incidence, and
to have held it his constitutional duty as representative and
champion of the whole people to lift up his voice against it
in their behalf. “My lord king,” he said, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">ii.16</a></span>“saving your
good pleasure, we will not give you this money as revenue,
for it is not yours. To your officers, who receive it as a
matter of grace rather than of right, we will give it willingly
so long as they do their duty; but on no other terms will
we be made to pay it at all.”—“By God’s Eyes!” swore the
astonished and angry king, “what right have you to contradict
me? I am doing no wrong to any man of yours. I
say the moneys shall be enrolled among my royal revenues.”—“Then
by those same Eyes,” swore Thomas in return,
“not a penny shall you have from my lands, or from any
lands of the Church!”<a id="Anchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 73.">[73]</a></p>

<p>How the debate ended we are not told; but one thing
we know: from that time forth the hated name of “Danegeld”
appeared in the Pipe Rolls no more. It seems therefore
that, for the first time in English history since the
Norman conquest, the right of the nation’s representatives
to oppose the financial demands of the Crown was asserted
in the council of Woodstock, and asserted with such success
that the king was obliged not merely to abandon his project,
but to obliterate the last trace of the tradition on which it
was founded. And it is well to remember, too, that the first
stand made by Thomas of Canterbury against the royal will
was made in behalf not of himself or his order but of his
whole flock;—in the cause not of ecclesiastical privilege
but of constitutional right. The king’s policy may have
been really sounder and wiser than the primate’s; but the
ground taken by Thomas at Woodstock entitles him none
the less to a place in the line of patriot-archbishops of which
Dunstan stands at the head.<a id="Anchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 74.">[74]</a></p>

<p>The next few weeks were occupied with litigation over
the alienated lands of the metropolitan see. A crowd of
claims put in by Thomas and left to await the king’s return
now came up for settlement, the most important case being
that of Earl Roger of Clare, whom Thomas had summoned
to perform his homage for Tunbridge at Westminster on
July 22. Roger answered that he held the entire fief by
knight-service, to be rendered in the shape of money-payment,<a id="Anchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 75.">[75]</a>
of the king and not of the primate.<a id="Anchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 76.">[76]</a> As Roger was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">ii.17</a></span>
connected with the noblest families in England,<a id="Anchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 77.">[77]</a> king and
barons were strongly on his side.<a id="Anchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 78.">[78]</a> To settle the question,
Henry ordered a general inquisition to be made throughout
England to ascertain where the service of each land-holder
was lawfully due. The investigation was of
course made by the royal justiciars; and when they
came to the archiepiscopal estates, one at least of the
most important fiefs in dispute was adjudged by them to
the Crown alone.<a id="Anchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 79.">[79]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile a dispute on a question of church patronage
arose between the primate and a tenant-in-chief of the
Crown, named William of Eynesford. Thomas excommunicated
his opponent without observing the custom
which required him to give notice to the king before inflicting
spiritual penalties on one of his tenants-in-chief.<a id="Anchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 80.">[80]</a> Henry
indignantly bade him withdraw the sentence; Thomas refused,
saying “it was not for the king to dictate who should
be bound or who loosed.”<a id="Anchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 81.">[81]</a> The answer was indisputable
in itself; but it pointed directly to the fatal subject on
which the inevitable quarrel must turn: the relations and
limits between the two powers of the keys and the
sword.</p>

<p>Almost from his accession Henry seems to have been
in some degree contemplating and preparing for those great
schemes of legal reform which were to be the lasting glory
of his reign. His earliest efforts in this direction were
merely tentative; the young king was at once too inexperienced
and too hard pressed with urgent business of all
kinds, at home and abroad, to have either capacity or
opportunity for great experiments in legislation. Throughout
the past nine years, however, the projects which floated
before his mind’s eye had been gradually taking shape;
and now that he was at last freed for a while from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">ii.18</a></span>
entanglements of politics and war, the time had come when
he might begin to devote himself to that branch of his
kingly duties for which he probably had the strongest inclination,
as he certainly had the highest natural genius.
He had by this time gained enough insight into the nature
and causes of existing abuses to venture upon dealing with
them systematically and in detail, and he had determined
to begin with a question which was allowed on all hands
to be one of the utmost gravity: the repression of crime in
the clergy.</p>

<p>The origin of this difficulty was in the separation—needful
perhaps, but none the less disastrous in some of its
consequences—made by William the Conqueror between
the temporal and ecclesiastical courts of justice. In
William’s intention the two sets of tribunals were to work
side by side without mutual interference save when the
secular power was called in to enforce the decisions of the
spiritual judge. But in practice the scheme was soon
found to involve a crowd of difficulties. The two jurisdictions
were constantly coming into contact, and it was a
perpetual question where to draw the line between them.
The struggle for the investitures, the religious revival which
followed it, the vast and rapid developement of the canon
law, with the increase of knowledge brought to bear upon
its interpretation through the revived study of the civil law
of Rome, gave the clergy a new sense of corporate importance
and strength, and a new position as a distinct
order in the state; the breakdown of all secular administration
under Stephen tended still further to exalt the
influence of the canonical system which alone retained
some vestige of legal authority, and to throw into the
Church-courts a mass of business with which they had
hitherto had only an indirect concern, but which they alone
now seemed capable of treating. Their proceedings were
conducted on the principles of the canon law, which admitted
of none but spiritual penalties; they refused to
allow any lay interference with the persons over whom they
claimed sole jurisdiction; and as these comprised the whole
clerical body in the widest possible sense, extending to all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">ii.19</a></span>
who had received the lowest orders of the Church or who
had taken monastic vows, the result was to place a considerable
part of the population altogether outside the
ordinary law of the land, and beyond the reach of adequate
punishment for the most heinous crimes. Such crimes were
only too common, and were necessarily fostered by this
system of clerical immunities; for a man capable of staining
his holy orders with theft or murder was not likely to
be restrained by the fear of losing them, which a clerical
criminal knew to be the worst punishment in store for
him; and moreover, it was but too easy for the doers of
such deeds to shelter themselves under the protection of a
privilege to which often they had no real title. The king’s
justiciars declared that in the nine years since Henry’s
accession more than a hundred murders, besides innumerable
robberies and lesser offences, had gone unpunished
because they were committed by clerks, or men who represented
themselves to be such.<a id="Anchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 82.">[82]</a> The scandal was acknowledged
on all hands; the spiritual party in the Church
grieved over it quite as loudly and deeply as the lay
reformers; but they hoped to remedy it in their own way,
by a searching reformation and a stringent enforcement of
spiritual discipline within the ranks of the clergy themselves.
The subject had first come under Henry’s direct
notice in the summer of 1158, when he received at York a
complaint from a citizen of Scarborough that a certain dean
had extorted money from him by unjust means. The case
was tried, in the king’s presence, before the archbishop of
the province, two bishops, and John of Canterbury the
treasurer of York. The dean failed in his defence; and as
it was proved that he had extorted the money by a libel,
an offence against which Henry had made a special decree,
some of the barons present were sent to see that the law
had its course. John of Canterbury, however, rose and
gave it as the decision of the spiritual judges that the
money should be restored to the citizen and the criminal
delivered over to the mercy of his metropolitan; and despite
the justiciar’s remonstrances, they refused to allow the king<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">ii.20</a></span>
any rights in the matter. Henry indignantly ordered an
appeal to the archbishop of Canterbury; but he was called
over sea before it could be heard,<a id="Anchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 83.">[83]</a> and had never returned
to England until now, when another archbishop sat in
Theobald’s place.</p>

<p>That it was Thomas of London who sat there was far
from being an indication that Henry had forgotten the incident.
It was precisely because Henry in these last four
years had thought over the question of the clerical immunities
and determined how to deal with it that he had sought
to place on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Augustine’s chair a man after his own heart.
He aimed at reducing the position of the clergy, like all
other doubtful matters, to the standard of his grandfather’s
time. He held that he had a right to whatever his ancestors
had enjoyed; he saw therein nothing derogatory to
either the Church or the primate, whom he rather intended
to exalt by making him his own inseparable colleague in
temporal administration and the supreme authority within
the realm in purely spiritual matters—thus avoiding the
appeals to Rome which had led to so much mischief, and
securing for himself a representative to whom he could
safely intrust the whole work of government in England as
guardian of the little king,<a id="Anchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 84.">[84]</a> while he himself would be free
to devote his whole energies to the management of his
continental affairs. He seems in fact to have hoped tacitly
to repeal the severance of the temporal and ecclesiastical
jurisdictions, and bring back the golden age of William and
Lanfranc, if not that of Eadgar and Dunstan; and for this
he, not unnaturally, counted unreservedly upon Thomas.
By slow degrees he discovered his miscalculation. Thomas
had given him one direct warning which had been unheeded;
he had warned him again indirectly by resigning
the chancellorship; now, when the king unfolded his plans,
he did not at once contradict him; he merely answered all
his arguments and persuasions with one set phrase<span class="nobreak">:—</span>“I
will render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s, and unto
God the things that are God’s.”<a id="Anchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 85.">[85]</a></p>

<p>In July occurred a typical case which brought matters
to a crisis. A clerk named Philip de Broi had been tried in
the bishop of Lincoln’s court for murder, had cleared himself
by a legal compurgation, and had been acquitted. The
king, not satisfied, commanded or permitted the charge to be
revived, and the accused to be summoned to take his trial at
Dunstable before Simon Fitz-Peter, then acting as justice-in-eyre
in Bedfordshire, where Philip dwelt. Philip indignantly
refused to plead again in answer to a charge of which he
had been acquitted, and overwhelmed the judge with abuse,
of which Simon on his return to London made formal complaint
to the king. Henry was furious, swore his wonted
oath “by God’s Eyes” that an insult to his minister was an
insult to himself, and ordered the culprit to be brought to
justice for the contempt of court and the homicide both at
once. The primate insisted that the trial should take place
in his own court at Canterbury, and to this Henry was compelled
unwillingly to consent. The charge of homicide was
quickly disposed of; Philip had been acquitted in a Church
court, and his present judges had no wish to reverse its
decision. On the charge of insulting a royal officer they
sentenced him to undergo a public scourging at the hands of
the offended person, and to forfeit the whole of his income
for the next two years, to be distributed in alms according to
the king’s pleasure. Henry declared the punishment insufficient,
and bitterly reproached the bishops with having perverted
justice out of favour to their order.<a id="Anchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 86.">[86]</a> They denied it;
but a story which came up from the diocese of Salisbury<a id="Anchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 87.">[87]</a>
and another from that of Worcester<a id="Anchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 88.">[88]</a> tended still further to
shew the helplessness of the royal justice against the ecclesiastical
courts under the protection of the primate; and the
latter’s blundering attempts to satisfy the king only increased
his irritation. Not only did Thomas venture beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">ii.22</a></span>
limits of punishment prescribed by the canon law by causing
a clerk who had been convicted of theft to be branded as
well as degraded,<a id="Anchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 89.">[89]</a> but he actually took upon himself to condemn
another to banishment.<a id="Anchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 90.">[90]</a> He hoped by these severe
sentences to appease the king’s wrath;<a id="Anchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 91.">[91]</a> Henry, on the
contrary, resented them as an interference with his rights;
what he wanted was not severe punishment in isolated
cases, but the power to inflict it in the regular course of
his own royal justice. At last he laid the whole question
before a great council which met at Westminster on
October 1.<a id="Anchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 92.">[92]</a></p>

<p>The king’s first proposition, that the bishops should confirm
the old customs observed in his grandfather’s days,<a id="Anchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 93.">[93]</a>
opened a discussion which lasted far into the night. Henry
himself proceeded to explain his meaning more fully; he
required, first, that the bishops should be more strict in the
pursuit of criminal clerks;<a id="Anchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 94.">[94]</a> secondly, that all such clerks,
when convicted and degraded, should be handed over to the
secular arm for temporal punishment like laymen, according
to the practice usual under Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>;<a id="Anchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 95.">[95]</a> and finally, that the
bishops should renounce their claim to inflict any temporal
punishment whatever, such as exile or imprisonment in a
monastery, which he declared to be an infringement of his
regal rights over the territory of his whole realm and the
persons of all his subjects.<a id="Anchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 96.">[96]</a> The primate, after vainly begging
for an adjournment till the morrow, retired to consult
with his suffragans.<a id="Anchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 97.">[97]</a> When he returned, it was to set forth
his view of the “two swords”—the two jurisdictions, spiritual
and temporal—in terms which put an end to all hope of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">ii.23</a></span>
agreement with the king. He declared the ministers of the
Heavenly King exempt from all subjection to the judgement
of an earthly sovereign; the utmost that he would concede
was that a clerk once degraded should thenceforth be treated
as a layman and punished as such if he offended again.<a id="Anchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 98.">[98]</a>
Henry, apparently too much astonished to argue further,
simply repeated his first question—“Would the bishops obey
the royal customs?” “Aye, saving our order,” was the
answer given by the primate in the name and with the
consent of all.<a id="Anchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 99.">[99]</a> When appealed to singly they all made the
same answer.<a id="Anchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 100.">[100]</a> Henry bade them withdraw the qualifying
phrase, and accept the customs unconditionally; they,
through the mouth of their primate, refused;<a id="Anchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 101.">[101]</a> the king
raged and swore, but all in vain. At last he strode suddenly
out of the hall without taking leave of the assembly;<a id="Anchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 102.">[102]</a> and
when morning broke they found that he had quitted London.<a id="Anchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 103.">[103]</a>
Before the day was over, Thomas received a summons to
surrender some honours which he had held as chancellor and
still retained;<a id="Anchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 104.">[104]</a> and soon afterwards the little Henry was
taken out of his care.<a id="Anchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 105.">[105]</a></p>

<p>The king’s wrath presently cooled so far that he invited the primate
to a conference at Northampton. They met on horseback in a field near
the town; high words passed between them; the king again demanded, and
the archbishop again refused, unconditional acceptance of the customs;
and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">ii.24</a></span> in this determination they parted.<a id="Anchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 106.">[106]</a> A private negotiation
with some of the other prelates—suggested, it was said, by
the diplomatist-bishop of Lisieux—was more successful;
Roger of York and Robert of Lincoln met the king at
Gloucester and agreed to accept his customs with no other
qualification than a promise on his part to exact nothing
contrary to the rights of their order. Hilary of Chichester
not only did the same but undertook to persuade the primate
himself. In this of course he failed.<a id="Anchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 107.">[107]</a> Some time before
Christmas, however, there came to the archbishop three
commissioners who professed to be sent by the Pope to bid
him withdraw his opposition; Henry having, according to
their story, assured the Pope that he had no designs against
the clergy or the Church, and required nothing beyond a
verbal assent for the saving of his regal dignity.<a id="Anchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 108.">[108]</a> On the
faith of their word Thomas met the king at Oxford,<a id="Anchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 109.">[109]</a> and
there promised to accept the customs and obey the king
“loyally and in good faith.” Henry then demanded that as
the archbishop had withstood him publicly, so his submission
should be repeated publicly too, in an assembly of barons
and clergy to be convened for that purpose.<a id="Anchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 110.">[110]</a> This was more
than Thomas had been led to expect; but he made no
objection, and the Christmas season passed over in peace.
Henry kept the feast at Berkhampstead,<a id="Anchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 111.">[111]</a> one of the castles
lately taken from the archbishop; Thomas at Canterbury,
where he had just been consecrating the great English scholar
Robert of Melun—one of the three Papal commissioners—to
succeed Gilbert Foliot as bishop of Hereford.<a id="Anchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 112.">[112]</a></p>

<p>On <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Hilary’s day the proposed council met at the royal
hunting-seat of Clarendon near Salisbury.<a id="Anchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 113.">[113]</a> Henry called
upon the archbishop to fulfil the promise he had given at
Oxford and publicly declare his assent to the customs.
Thomas drew back. As he saw the mighty array of barons
round the king—as he looked over the ranks of his own
fellow-bishops—it flashed at last even upon his unsuspicious
mind that all this anxiety to draw him into such a public
repetition of a scene which he had thought to be final must
cover something more than the supposed papal envoys had
led him to expect, and that those “customs” which he had
been assured were but a harmless word might yet become a
terrible reality if he yielded another step. His hesitation
threw the king into one of those paroxysms of Angevin
fury which scared the English and Norman courtiers almost
out of their senses. Thomas alone remained undaunted;
the bishops stood “like a flock of sheep ready for slaughter,”
and the king’s own ministers implored the primate to save
them from the shame of having to lay violent hands upon
him at their sovereign’s command. For two days he stood
firm; on the third two knights of the Temple brought him a
solemn assurance, on the honour of their order and the salvation
of their souls, that his fears were groundless and that a
verbal submission to the king’s will would end the quarrel
and restore peace to the Church. He believed them; and
though he still shrank from the formality, thus emptied of
meaning, as little better than a lie, yet for the Church’s sake
he gave way. He publicly promised to obey the king’s laws
and customs loyally and in good faith, and made all the
other bishops do likewise.<a id="Anchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 114.">[114]</a></p>

<p>The words were no sooner out of their mouths than
Thomas learned how just his suspicions had been. A question
was instantly raised—what were these customs? It
was too late to discuss them that night; next morning the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">ii.26</a></span>
king bade the oldest and wisest of the barons go and make
a recognition of the customs observed by his grandfather
and bring up a written report of them for ratification by the
council.<a id="Anchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 115.">[115]</a> Nine days later<a id="Anchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 116.">[116]</a> the report was presented. It
comprised sixteen articles, known ever since as the Constitutions
of Clarendon.<a id="Anchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 117.">[117]</a> Some of them merely re-affirmed, in a
more stringent and technical manner, the rules of William
the Conqueror forbidding bishops and beneficed clerks to
quit the realm or excommunicate the king’s tenants-in-chief
without his leave, and the terms on which the temporal
position of the bishops had been settled by the compromise
between Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> and Anselm at the close of the struggle for
the investitures. Another aimed at checking the abuse of
appeals to Rome, by providing that no appeal should be
carried further than the archbishop’s court without the assent
of the king. The remainder dealt with the settlement of
disputes concerning presentations and advowsons, which were
transferred from the ecclesiastical courts to that of the king;
the treatment of excommunicate persons; the limits of the
right of sanctuary as regarding the goods of persons who
had incurred forfeiture to the Crown; the ordination of
villeins; the jurisdiction over clerks accused of crime; the
protection of laymen cited before the Church courts against
episcopal and archidiaconal injustice; and the method of
procedure in suits concerning the tenure of Church lands.</p>

<p>The two articles last mentioned are especially remarkable.
The former provided that if a layman was accused
before a bishop on insufficient testimony, the sheriff should
at the bishop’s request summon a jury of twelve lawful men
of the neighbourhood to swear to the truth or falsehood of
the charge.<a id="Anchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 118.">[118]</a> The other clause decreed that when an estate
was claimed by a clerk in frank-almoign and by a layman as
a secular fief the question should be settled by the chief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">ii.27</a></span>
justiciar in like manner on the recognition of twelve jurors.<a id="Anchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 119.">[119]</a>
The way in which these provisions are introduced implies
that the principle contained in them was already well known
in the country; it indicates that some steps had already
been taken towards a general remodelling of legal procedure,
intended to embrace all branches of judicial administration
and bring them all into orderly and harmonious working.
In this view the Constitutions of Clarendon were only part
of a great scheme in whose complete developement they
might have held an appropriate and useful place.<a id="Anchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 120.">[120]</a> But the
churchmen of the day, to whom they were thus suddenly
presented as an isolated fragment, could hardly be expected
to see in them anything but an engine of state tyranny for
grinding down the Church. Almost every one of them
assumed, in some way or other, the complete subordination
of ecclesiastical to temporal authority; the right of lay jurisdiction
over clerks was asserted in the most uncompromising
terms; while the last clause of all, which forbade the ordination
of villeins without the consent of their lords, stirred a
nobler feeling than jealousy for mere class-privileges. Its
real intention was probably not to hinder the enfranchisement
of serfs, but simply to protect the landowners against
the loss of services which, being attached to the soil, they
had no means of replacing, and very possibly also to prevent
the number of criminal clerks being further increased by the
admission of villeins anxious to escape from the justice of
their lords. But men who for ages had been trained to
regard the Church as a divinely-appointed city of refuge for
all the poor and needy, the oppressed and the enslaved, could
only see the other side of the measure and feel their inmost
hearts rise up in the cry of a contemporary poet—“Hath
not God called us all, bond and free, to His service?”<a id="Anchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 121.">[121]</a></p>

It should be noticed that this was clearly understood, and full justice was

This, variously expressed, was the grand argument of
the clerical-democratic party, and the true source of their strength. And they
were not altogether wrong in attributing the action of their opponents, in part at
least, to aristocratic contempt and exclusiveness—if we may trust Gervase of
Canterbury’s report of a complaint said to have been uttered at a later time by the
king: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hi quoque omnes” [<span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><i>i.e.</i> the religious orders</span>] “tales sibi fratres associant,

<p>The discussion occupied six days;<a id="Anchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 122.">[122]</a> as each clause was
read out to the assembly, Thomas rose and set forth his
reasons for opposing it.<a id="Anchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 123.">[123]</a> When at last the end was reached,
Henry called upon him and all the bishops to affix their
seals to the constitutions. “Never,” burst out the primate—“never,
while there is a breath left in my body!”<a id="Anchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 124.">[124]</a> The
king was obliged to content himself with the former verbal
assent, gained on false pretences as it had been; a copy of
the obnoxious document was handed to the primate, who
took it, as he said, for a witness against its contrivers, and
indignantly quitted the assembly.<a id="Anchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 125.">[125]</a> In an agony of remorse
for the credulity which had led him into such a trap he
withdrew to Winchester and suspended himself from all

Pope.<a id="Anchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 126.">[126]</a></p>

<p>It was to the Pope that both parties looked for a settlement
of their dispute; but Alexander, ill acquainted both
with the merits of the case and with the characters of the
disputants, and beset on all sides with political difficulties,
could only strive in vain to hold the balance evenly between
them. Meanwhile the political quarrel of king and primate
was embittered by an incident in which Henry’s personal
feelings were stirred. His brother William—the favourite
young brother whom he had once planned to establish as
sovereign in Ireland—had set his heart upon a marriage
with the widowed countess of Warren; the archbishop had
forbidden the match on the ground of affinity, and his prohibition
had put an end to the scheme.<a id="Anchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 127.">[127]</a> Baffled and indignant,
William returned to Normandy and poured the story
of his grievance into the sympathizing ears first of his
mother and then, as it seems, of the brotherhood at Bec.<a id="Anchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 128.">[128]</a>
On January 29, 1164—one day before the dissolution of
the council of Clarendon—he died at Rouen;<a id="Anchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 129.">[129]</a> and a writer
who was himself at that time a monk at Bec not only implies
his own belief that the young man actually died of disappointment,
but declares that Henry shared that belief, and
thenceforth looked upon the primate by whom the disappointment
had been caused as little less than the murderer of his
brother.<a id="Anchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 130.">[130]</a> The king’s exasperation was at any rate plain to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">ii.30</a></span>
all eyes; and as the summer drew on Thomas found himself
gradually deserted. His best friend, John of Salisbury,
had already been taken from his side, and was soon driven
into exile by the jealousy of the king;<a id="Anchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 131.">[131]</a> another friend, John
of Canterbury, had been removed out of the country early
in 1163 by the ingenious device of making him bishop of
Poitiers.<a id="Anchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 132.">[132]</a> The old dispute concerning the relations between
Canterbury and York had broken out afresh with intensified
bitterness between Roger of Pont-l’Evêque and the former
comrade of whom he had long been jealous, and who had
now once again been promoted over his head; the king,
hoping to turn it to account for his own purposes, was intriguing
at the Papal court in Roger’s behalf, and one of
his confidential agents there was Thomas’s own archdeacon,
Geoffrey Ridel.<a id="Anchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 133.">[133]</a> The bishops as yet were passive; in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">ii.31</a></span>
York controversy Gilbert Foliot strongly supported his own
metropolitan;<a id="Anchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 134.">[134]</a> but between him and Thomas there was
already a question, amicable indeed at present but ominous
nevertheless, as to whether or not the profession of obedience
made to Theobald by the bishop of Hereford should be
repeated by the same man as bishop of London to Theobald’s
successor.<a id="Anchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 135.">[135]</a></p>

Considering the abundance—one
might almost say superabundance—of unquestionably authentic information
which we already possess as to the origin and grounds of Henry’s quarrel with
Thomas, I cannot attach so much importance as Mr. Howlett apparently does
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="preface">pref.</abbr> <abbr title="pages 61–63">pp. lxi–lxiii</abbr></cite>)
to this new contribution from Stephen of Rouen. Stephen’s
work is quasi-romantic in character and utterly unhistoric in style; and his view
of the whole Becket controversy is simply ludicrous, for he ignores the clerical
immunities and the Constitutions of Clarendon altogether, and attributes the
quarrel wholly to two other causes—this affair about William, and Thomas’s supposed
peculations while chancellor
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="book 3">l. iii.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 12, <abbr title="verses">vv.</abbr> 909–914, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 741</cite>).
That
the domestic tragedy of which he gives such a highly-coloured account had some
bearing upon the great political drama appears from the words of Richard le
Breton to Thomas at his murder seven years later, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hoc habeas pro amore
domini mei Willelmi fratris regis</span>”
    (<cite><abbr title="William Fitz-Stephen">Will. Fitz-Steph.</abbr>, Robertson, <i>Becket</i>, <abbr title="volume 3">vol. iii.</abbr>
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 142</cite>).
But in these words there is no mention either of William’s death or of
Henry’s feelings about it. Some allusion to either or both may have been in the
speaker’s mind; but what he actually said implies nothing more than that he had
been in William’s service, and had therefore resented the thwarting of his lord’s interests,
and through them, it may be, of his own. <abbr title="William Fitz-Stephen">Will. Fitz-Steph.</abbr>, after explaining
what William’s grievance was, simply adds, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unde Willelmus <span class="dots">...</span> inconsolabiliter

it appears that John was separated from
Thomas before the council of Clarendon. After some months of wandering he
found shelter at Reims, in the great abbey of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Remigius of which his old
friend Peter of Celle was now abbot, and there he chiefly dwelt during the next
seven years.

<p>Thomas himself fully expected to meet the fate of
Anselm; throughout the winter his friends had been endeavouring
to secure him a refuge in France;<a id="Anchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 136.">[136]</a> and early in
the summer of 1164, having been refused an interview with
the king,<a id="Anchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 137.">[137]</a> he made two attempts to escape secretly from
Romney. The first time he was repelled by a contrary
wind; the second time the sailors put back ostensibly for
the same reason, but really because they had recognized
their passenger and dreaded the royal wrath;<a id="Anchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 138.">[138]</a> and a servant
who went on the following night to shut the gates of the
deserted palace at Canterbury found the primate, worn out
with fatigue and disappointment, sitting alone in the darkness
like a beggar upon his own door-step.<a id="Anchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 139.">[139]</a> Despairing of
escape, he made another effort to see the king at Woodstock.
Henry dreaded nothing so much as the archbishop’s
flight, for he felt that it would probably be followed by a
Papal interdict on his dominions,<a id="Anchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 140.">[140]</a> and would certainly give
an immense advantage against him to Louis of France, who
was at that very moment threatening war in Auvergne.<a id="Anchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 141.">[141]</a>
He therefore received Thomas courteously, though with
somewhat less than the usual honours,<a id="Anchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 142.">[142]</a> and made no allusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">ii.32</a></span>
to the past except by a playful question “whether the archbishop
did not think the realm was wide enough to contain
them both?” Thomas saw, however, that the old cordiality
was gone; his enemies saw it too, and, as his biographer
says, “they came about him like bees.”<a id="Anchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 143.">[143]</a> Foremost among
them was John the king’s marshal, who had a suit in the
archbishop’s court concerning the manor of Pageham.<a id="Anchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 144.">[144]</a> It
was provided by one of Henry’s new rules of legal procedure
that if a suitor saw no chance of obtaining justice in
the court of his own lord he might, by taking an oath to
that effect and bringing two witnesses to do the same,
transfer the suit to a higher court.<a id="Anchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 145.">[145]</a> John by this method
removed his case from the court of the archbishop to that of
the king; and thither Thomas was cited to answer his claim on
the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross. When that day came
the primate was too ill to move; he sent essoiners to excuse
his absence in legal form, and also a written protest against
the removal of the suit, on the ground that it had been obtained
by perjury—John having taken the oath not upon
the Gospel, but upon an old song-book which he had surreptitiously
brought into court for the purpose.<a id="Anchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 146.">[146]</a> Henry angrily
refused to believe either Thomas or his essoiners,<a id="Anchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 147.">[147]</a> and immediately
issued orders for a great council to be held at
Northampton.<a id="Anchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 148.">[148]</a> It was customary to call the archbishops
and the greater barons by a special writ addressed to each
individually, while the lesser tenants-in-chief received a
general summons through the sheriffs of the different
counties. Roger of York was specially called in due form;<a id="Anchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 149.">[149]</a>
the metropolitan of all Britain, who ought to have been invited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">ii.33</a></span>
first and most honourably of all, merely received
through the sheriff of Kent a peremptory citation to be
ready on the first day of the council with his defence against
the claim of John the marshal.<a id="Anchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 150.">[150]</a></p>

<p>The council—an almost complete gathering of the tenants-in-chief,
lay and spiritual, throughout the realm<a id="Anchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 151.">[151]</a>—was
summoned for Tuesday October 6.<a id="Anchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 152.">[152]</a> The king however
lingered hawking by the river-side till late at night,<a id="Anchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 153.">[153]</a> and it
was not till next morning after Mass that the archbishop
could obtain an audience. He began by asking leave to go
and consult the Pope on his dispute with Roger of York and
divers other questions touching the interests of both Church
and state; Henry angrily bade him be silent and retire to
prepare his defence for his contempt of the royal summons
in the matter of John the marshal.<a id="Anchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 154.">[154]</a> The trial took place
next day. John himself did not appear, being detained in
the king’s service at the Michaelmas session of the Exchequer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">ii.34</a></span>
in London;<a id="Anchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 155.">[155]</a> the charge of failure of justice was apparently
withdrawn, but for the alleged contempt Thomas was sentenced
to a fine of five hundred pounds.<a id="Anchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 156.">[156]</a> Indignant as he
was at the flagrant illegality of the trial, in which his own
suffragans had been compelled to sit in judgement on their
primate, Thomas was yet persuaded to submit, in the hope
of avoiding further wrangling over what seemed now to have
become a mere question of money.<a id="Anchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 157.">[157]</a> But there were other
questions to follow. Henry now demanded from the archbishop
a sum of three hundred pounds, representing the
revenue due from the honours of Eye and Berkhampstead
for the time during which he had held them since his resignation
of the chancellorship.<a id="Anchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 158.">[158]</a> Thomas remarked that he
had spent far more than that sum on the repair of the
royal palaces, and protested against the unfairness of making
such a demand without warning. Still, however, he disdained
to resist for a matter of filthy lucre, and found
sureties for the required amount.<a id="Anchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 159.">[159]</a> Next morning Henry
made a further demand for the repayment of a loan made
to Thomas in his chancellor days.<a id="Anchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 160.">[160]</a> In those days the two
friends had virtually had but one purse as well as “one
mind and one heart,” and Thomas was deeply wounded by
this evident proof that their friendship was at an end. Once
more he submitted; but this time it was no easy matter to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">ii.35</a></span>
find sureties;<a id="Anchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 161.">[161]</a> and then, late on the Friday evening, there
was reached the last and most overwhelming count in the
long indictment thus gradually unrolled before the eyes of
the astonished primate. He was called upon to render a
complete statement of all the revenues of vacant sees,
baronies and honours of which he had had the custody as
chancellor—in short, of the whole accounts of the chancery
during his tenure of office.<a id="Anchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 162.">[162]</a></p>

says
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">hebdomadæ feria quinta, sexta ante <abbr title="Beati">B.</abbr> Calixti <span class="dots">...</span> diem</span>”—a self-contradiction,
for in 1164 October 9, the sixth day before the feast of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Calixtus, was
not Thursday but Friday. He makes, however, a similar confusion as to the
last day of the council
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 301, 304, 326</cite>);
and as this was undoubtedly
Tuesday October 13—not Wednesday 14, as he seems to make it in
    <cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 304</cite>
—it is plain that his mistake lies in placing the feast of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Calixtus a day too early,
and that the day to which he really means to assign the opening of the assembly
is Thursday October 8. This really agrees with <abbr title="William Fitz-Stephen">Will. Fitz-Steph.</abbr>, for, as will be
seen, the council did not formally meet till a day after that for which it was summoned,
and did not get to business till a day later still. William gives the date
for which it had been summoned; Herbert, that of its practical beginning.

however (as above), makes it thirty thousand marks (<i>i.e.</i> twenty thousand pounds). The
    <cite><i>Thomas Saga</i> (Magnusson), <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 191</cite>,
says thirty thousand marks “of burnt silver,”
<i>i.e.</i> blanch; while Gilbert Foliot, when reciting the story to the Pope’s legates in

<p>At this crushing demand the archbishop’s courage gave
way, and he threw himself at the king’s feet in despair. All
the bishops did likewise, but in vain; Henry swore “by
God’s Eyes” that he would have the accounts in full. He
granted, however, a respite till the morrow,<a id="Anchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 163.">[163]</a> and Thomas
spent the next morning in consultation with his suffragans.<a id="Anchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 164.">[164]</a>
Gilbert of London advised unconditional surrender;<a id="Anchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 165.">[165]</a> Henry
of Winchester, who had already withstood the king to his
face the night before,<a id="Anchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 166.">[166]</a> strongly opposed this view,<a id="Anchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 167.">[167]</a> and suggested
that the matter should be compromised by an offer
of two thousand marks. This the king rejected.<a id="Anchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 168.">[168]</a> After
long deliberation<a id="Anchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 169.">[169]</a> it was decided—again at the suggestion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">ii.36</a></span>
of Bishop Henry—that Thomas should refuse to entertain
the king’s demands on the ground of the release from all
secular obligations granted to him at his consecration. This
answer was carried by the bishops in a body to the king.
He refused to accept it, declaring that the release had been
given without his authority; and all that the bishops could
wring from him was a further adjournment till the Monday
morning.<a id="Anchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 170.">[170]</a> In the middle of Sunday night the highly-strung
nervous organization of Thomas broke down under the long
cruel strain; the morning found him lying in helpless agony,
and with great difficulty he obtained from the king another
day’s delay.<a id="Anchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 171.">[171]</a> Before it expired a warning reached him from
the court that if he appeared there he must expect nothing
short of imprisonment or death.<a id="Anchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 172.">[172]</a> A like rumour spread
through the council, and at dawn the bishops in a body implored
their primate to give up the hopeless struggle and
throw himself on the mercy of the king. He refused to
betray his Church by accepting a sentence which he believed
to be illegal as well as unjust, forbade the bishops to take
any further part in his trial, gave them notice of an appeal
to Rome if they should do so, and charged them on their
canonical obedience to excommunicate at once whatever
laymen should dare to sit in judgement upon him.<a id="Anchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 173.">[173]</a> Against
this last command the bishop of London instantly appealed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">ii.37</a></span><a id="Anchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 174.">[174]</a>
All then returned to the court, except Henry of Winchester
and Jocelyn of Salisbury, who lingered for a last word of
pleading or of sympathy.<a id="Anchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 175.">[175]</a> When they too were gone,
Thomas went to the chapel of the monastery in which he
was lodging—a small Benedictine house dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Andrew, just outside the walls of Northampton—and with
the utmost solemnity celebrated the mass of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Stephen with
its significant introit: “Princes have sat and spoken against
me.” The mass ended, he mounted his horse, and escorted
no longer by a brilliant train of clerks and knights, but by a
crowd of poor folk full of sympathy and admiration, he rode
straight to the castle where the council awaited him.<a id="Anchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 176.">[176]</a></p>

<p>At the gate he took his cross from the attendant who
usually bore it, and went forward alone to the hall where the
bishops and barons were assembled.<a id="Anchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 177.">[177]</a> They fell back in
amazement at the apparition of the tall solitary figure, robed
in full pontificals, and carrying the crucifix like an uplifted
banner prepared at once for defence and for defiance; friends
and opponents were almost equally shocked, and it was not
till he had passed through their midst and seated himself in
a corner of the hall that the bishops recovered sufficiently to
gather round him and intreat that he would give up his unbecoming
burthen. Thomas refused; “he would not lay
down his standard, he would not part with his shield.” “A
fool you ever were, a fool I see you are still and will be to
the end,” burst out Gilbert Foliot at last, as after a long
argument he turned impatiently away.<a id="Anchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 178.">[178]</a> The others followed
him, and the primate was left with only two companions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">ii.38</a></span>
William Fitz-Stephen and his own especial friend, Herbert
of Bosham.<a id="Anchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 179.">[179]</a> The king had retired to an inner chamber and
was there deliberating with his most intimate counsellors<a id="Anchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 180.">[180]</a>
when the story of the primate’s entrance reached his ears.
He took it as an unpardonable insult, and caused Thomas to
be proclaimed a traitor. Warnings and threats ran confusedly
through the hall. The archbishop bent over the
disciple sitting at his feet<span class="nobreak">:—</span>“For thee I fear—yet fear not
thou; even now mayest thou share my crown.” The ardent
encouragement with which Herbert answered him<a id="Anchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 181.">[181]</a> provoked
one of the king’s marshals to interfere and forbid that any
one should speak to the “traitor.” William Fitz-Stephen,
who had been vainly striving to put in a gentle word, caught
his primate’s eyes and pointed to the crucifix, intrusting to
its silent eloquence the lesson of patience and prayer which
his lips were forbidden to utter. When he and Thomas,
after long separation, met again in the land of exile, that
speechless admonition seems to have been the first thing
which recurred to the minds of both.<a id="Anchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 182.">[182]</a></p>

<p>In the chamber overhead, meanwhile, Henry had summoned
the bishops to a conference.<a id="Anchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 183.">[183]</a> On receiving from
them an account of their morning’s interview with Thomas,
he sent down to the latter his ultimatum, requiring him to
withdraw his appeal to Rome and his commands to the
bishops as contrary to the customs which he had sworn to
observe, and to submit to the judgement of the king’s court
on the chancery accounts. Seated, with eyes fixed on the
cross, Thomas quietly but firmly refused. His refusal was
reported to the king, who grew fiery-red with rage, caught
eagerly at the barons’ proposal that the archbishop should
be judged for contempt of his sovereign’s jurisdiction in appealing
from it to another tribunal, and called upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">ii.39</a></span>
bishops to join in his condemnation.<a id="Anchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 184.">[184]</a> York, London and
Chichester proposed that they should cite him before the
Pope instead, on the grounds of perjury at Clarendon and
unjust demands on their obedience.<a id="Anchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 185.">[185]</a> To this Henry consented;
the appeal was uttered by Hilary of Chichester in
the name of all, and in most insulting terms;<a id="Anchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 186.">[186]</a> and the
bishops sat down opposite their primate to await the
sentence of the lay barons.<a id="Anchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 187.">[187]</a></p>

<p>What that sentence was no one outside the royal council-chamber
ever really knew. It was one thing to determine
it there and another to deliver it to its victim, sitting alone
and unmoved with the sign of victory in his hand. With
the utmost reluctance and hesitation the old justiciar, Earl
Robert of Leicester, came to perform his odious task. At
the word “judgement” Thomas started up, with uplifted
crucifix and flashing eyes, forbade the speaker to proceed,
and solemnly appealed to the protection of the court of
Rome. The justiciar and his companions retired in silence.<a id="Anchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 188.">[188]</a>
“I too will go, for the hour is past,” said Thomas.<a id="Anchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 189.">[189]</a> Cross
in hand he strode past the speechless group of bishops into
the outer hall; the courtiers followed him with a torrent of
insults, which were taken up by the squires and serving-men
outside; as he stumbled against a pile of faggots set
ready for the fire, Ralf de Broc rushed upon him with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">ii.40</a></span>
shout of “Traitor! traitor!”<a id="Anchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 190.">[190]</a> The king’s half-brother,
Count Hameline, echoed the cry;<a id="Anchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 191.">[191]</a> but he shrank back at
the primate’s retort—“Were I a knight instead of a priest,
this hand should prove thee a liar!”<a id="Anchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 192.">[192]</a> Amid a storm of
abuse Thomas made his way into the court-yard and sprang
upon his horse, taking up his faithful Herbert behind him.<a id="Anchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 193.">[193]</a>
The outer gate was locked, but a squire of the archbishop
managed to find the keys.<a id="Anchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 194.">[194]</a> Whether there was any real
intention of stopping his egress it seems impossible to determine;
the king and his counsellors were apparently too
much puzzled to do anything but let matters take their
course; Henry indeed sent down a herald to quell the
disturbance and forbid all violence to the primate;<a id="Anchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 195.">[195]</a> but the
precaution came too late. Once outside the gates, Thomas
had no need of such protection. From the mob of hooting
enemies within he passed into the midst of a crowd of poor
folk who pressed upon him with every demonstration of
rapturous affection; in every street as he rode along the
people came out to throw themselves at his feet and beg
his blessing.</p>

<p>It was with these poor folk that he supped that night,
for his own household, all save a chosen few, now hastened
to take leave of him.<a id="Anchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 196.">[196]</a> Through the bishops of Rochester,
Hereford and Worcester he requested of the king a safe-conduct
for his journey to Canterbury; the king declined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">ii.41</a></span>
to answer till the morrow.<a id="Anchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 197.">[197]</a> The primate’s suspicions were
aroused. He caused his bed to be laid in the church, as if
intending to spend the night in prayer.<a id="Anchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 198.">[198]</a> At cock-crow the
monks came and sang their matins in an under-tone for
fear of disturbing their weary guest;<a id="Anchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 199.">[199]</a> but his chamberlain
was watching over an empty couch. At dead of night
Thomas had made his escape with two canons of Sempringham
and a faithful squire of his own, named Roger of Brai.
A violent storm of rain helped to cover their flight,<a id="Anchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 200.">[200]</a> and it
was not till the middle of the next day that king and

<p>“God’s blessing go with him!” murmured with a sigh
of relief the aged Bishop Henry of Winchester. “We
have not done with him yet!” cried the king. He at
once issued orders that all the ports should be watched to
prevent Thomas from leaving the country,<a id="Anchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 201.">[201]</a> and that the
temporalities of the metropolitan see should be left untouched
pending an appeal to the Pope<a id="Anchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 202.">[202]</a> which he despatched
the archbishop of York and the bishops of
London, Worcester, Exeter and Chichester to prosecute
without delay.<a id="Anchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 203.">[203]</a> They sailed from Dover on All Souls day;<a id="Anchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 204.">[204]</a>
that very night Thomas, after three weeks of adventurous
wanderings, guarded with the most devoted vigilance by the
brethren of Sempringham, embarked in a little boat from
Sandwich; next day he landed in Flanders;<a id="Anchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 205.">[205]</a> and after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">ii.42</a></span>
another fortnight’s hiding he made his way safe to Soissons,
where the king of France, disregarding an embassy sent by
Henry to prevent him, welcomed him with open arms. He
hurried on to Sens, where the Pope was now dwelling; the
appellant bishops had preceded him, but Alexander was
deaf to their arguments.<a id="Anchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 206.">[206]</a> Thomas laid at the Pope’s feet
his copy of the Constitutions of Clarendon; they were read,
discussed and solemnly condemned in full consistory.<a id="Anchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 207.">[207]</a> The
exiled primate withdrew to a shelter which his friend Bishop
John of Poitiers had secured for him in the Cistercian abbey of
Pontigny in Burgundy.<a id="Anchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 208.">[208]</a> On Christmas-eve, at Marlborough,
Henry’s envoys reported to him the failure of their mission.
On <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Stephen’s day Henry confiscated the whole possessions
of the metropolitan see, of the primate himself and of
all his clerks, and ordered all his kindred and dependents,
clerical or lay, to be banished from the realm.<a id="Anchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 209.">[209]</a></p>

The formal record
of these proceedings is the edition of the Constitutions included among the
collected letters of
    <cite><abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas—<abbr title="Epistle 45">Ep. xlv.</abbr> (<i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="volume 5">vol. v.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 71–79)</cite>,
in which there
is appended to each article the Pope’s verdict—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hoc toleravit</span>” or “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hoc
damnavit</span>.” The tolerated articles are 2, 6, 11, 13, 14 and 16. Alan of
Tewkesbury, who first collected the letters of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas, was for some years a
canon of Benevento, and probably got this annotated copy of the Constitutions
from Lombard, who had been in Thomas’s suite as one of his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eruditi</i> during this
visit to Sens, and who was archbishop of Benevento at the time of Alan’s residence
there.

<span class="note_title">THE COUNCIL OF WOODSTOCK.</span></h4>

<p>The usual view of the council of Woodstock—a view founded
on contemporary accounts and endorsed by Bishop Stubbs ( <cite><i><abbr title="Constitutional History">Constit.
Hist.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 462</cite>)—has been disputed on the authority of the
Icelandic <cite><i>Thomas Saga</i></cite>. This Saga represents the subject of the
quarrel as being, not a general levy of so much per hide throughout
the country, but a special tax upon the Church lands—nothing
else, in fact, than the “ungeld” which William Rufus had imposed
on them to raise the money paid to Duke Robert for his temporary
cession of Normandy, and which had been continued ever since.
“We have read afore how King William levied a due on all
churches in the land, in order to repay him all the costs at which
his brother Robert did depart from the land. This money the
king said he had disbursed for the freedom of Jewry, and therefore
it behoved well the learned folk to repay it to their king. But
because the king’s court hath a mouth that holdeth fast, this due
continued from year to year. At first it was called Jerusalem tax,
but afterwards Warfare-due, for the king to keep up an army for the
common peace of the country. But at this time matters have
gone so far, that this due was exacted, as a king’s tax, from every
house” [“monastery,” editor’s note], “small and great, throughout
England, under no other name than an ancient tax payable into
the royal treasury without any reason being shown for it.” <cite><i>Thomas
Saga</i> (Magnusson), <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 139</cite>. Mr. Magnusson (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 138,
note 7</cite>) thinks that this account “must be taken as representing
the true history of” the tax in question. In his Preface (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr>
<abbr title="pages 107–108">pp. cvii–cviii</abbr></cite>) he argues that if the tax had been one upon the
tax-payers in general, “evidently the primate had no right to interfere
in such a matter, except so far as church lands were concerned;”
and he concludes that the version in the Saga “gives a
natural clue to the archbishop’s protest, which thus becomes a protest
only on behalf of the Church.” This argument hardly takes
sufficient account of the English primate’s constitutional position,
which furnishes a perfectly “natural clue” to his protest, supposing
that protest to have been made on behalf of the whole nation and
not only of the Church<span class="nobreak">:—</span>or rather, to speak more accurately, in
behalf of the Church in the true sense of that word—the sense
which Theobald’s disciples were always striving to give to it—as
representing the whole nation viewed in a spiritual aspect, and not
only the clerical order. Mr. Magnusson adds: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">ii.44</a></span>“We have no
doubt that the source of the Icelandic Saga here is Robert of
Cricklade, or <span class="dots">...</span> Benedict of Peterborough, who has had a
better information on the subject than the other authorities, which,
it would seem, all have Garnier for a primary source; but he, a
foreigner, might very well be supposed to have formed an erroneous
view on a subject the history of which he did not know, except by
hearsay evidence” (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="pages 108, 109">pp. cviii, cix</abbr></cite>). It might be answered
that the “hearsay evidence” on which Garnier founded his view
must have been evidence which he heard in England, where he is
known to have carefully collected the materials for his work
(<cite>Garnier, <abbr title="edited by">ed.</abbr> Hippeau, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 6, 205, 206</cite>), and that his view is entitled
to just as much consideration as that of the Icelander,
founded upon the evidence of Robert or Benedict;—that of the
three writers who follow Garnier, two, William of Canterbury and
Edward Grim, were English (William of Canterbury may have been
Irish by birth, but he was English by education and domicile) and
might therefore have been able to check any errors caused by the
different nationality of their guide<span class="nobreak">:—</span>and that even if the case
resolved itself into a question between the authority of Garnier and
that of Benedict or Robert (which can hardly be admitted), they
would be of at least equal weight, and the balance of intrinsic
probability would be on Garnier’s side. For his story points directly
to the Danegeld; and we have the indisputable witness of the Pipe
Rolls that the Danegeld, in some shape or other, was levied at
intervals throughout the Norman reigns and until the year 1163,
when it vanished for ever. On the other hand, the Red King’s
“ungeld” upon the Church lands, like all his other “ungelds,”
certainly died with him; and nothing can well be more unlikely
than that Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> in the very midst of his early reforms should
have reintroduced, entirely without excuse and without necessity,
one of the most obnoxious and unjust of the measures which had
been expressly abolished in “the time of his grandfather King
Henry.”</p>

<span class="note_title">THE COUNCIL OF CLARENDON.</span></h4>

<p>There is some difficulty as to both the date and the duration of
this council. <cite><abbr title="Gervase of Canterbury">Gerv. Cant.</abbr> (Stubbs, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 176</cite>) gives the date of
meeting as January 13; <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Ralf de Diceto">R. Diceto</abbr> (Stubbs, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 312)</cite> as January
25; while the official copy of the Constitutions (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Summa Causæ</i>,
Robertson, <i>Becket</i>, <abbr title="volume 4">vol. iv.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 208</cite>;
    <cite>Stubbs, <i>Select Charters</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 140</cite>)
gives the closing day as January 30 (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quartâ die ante Purificationem
<abbr title="Sanctae">S.</abbr> Mariæ</i></span>”). As to the duration of the council, we learn from
<cite><abbr title="Herbert of Bosham">Herb. Bosh.</abbr> (Robertson, <i>Becket</i>, <abbr title="volume 3">vol. iii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 279)</cite> and <cite><abbr title="Gervase of Canterbury">Gerv. Cant.</abbr><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">ii.45</a></span>
(as above, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 178)</cite> that there was an adjournment of at least one
night; while <cite>Gilbert Foliot (Robertson, <i>Becket</i>, <abbr title="volume 5">vol. v.</abbr> <abbr title="Epistle 225">Ep. ccxxv.</abbr>
<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 527–529)</cite> says “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clarendonæ <span class="dots">...</span> continuato triduo id solum
actum est ut observandarum regni consuetudinum et dignitatum a
nobis fieret absoluta promissio</span>;” and that “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">die vero tertio</span>,” after a
most extraordinary scene, Thomas “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">antiquas regni consuetudines
antiquorum memoriâ in commune propositas et scripto commendatas,
de cætero domino nostro regi se fideliter observaturum in
verbo veritatis absolute promittens, in vi nobis injunxit obedientiæ
sponsione simili nos obligare</span>.” This looks at first glance as if
meant to describe the closing scene of the council, in which case
its whole duration would be limited to three days. But it seems
possible to find another interpretation which would enable us to
reconcile all the discordant dates, by understanding Gilbert’s words
as referring to the verbal discussion at the opening of the council,
before the written Constitutions were produced at all. Gilbert does
indeed expressly mention “customs committed to writing”; but
this may very easily be a piece of confusion either accidental or
intentional. On this supposition the chronology may be arranged
as follows<span class="nobreak">:—</span>The council meets on January 13 (<cite><abbr title="Gervase of Canterbury">Gerv. Cant.</abbr></cite>). That
day and the two following are spent in talking over the primate;
towards evening of the third—which will be January 15—he yields,
and the bishops with him (<cite><abbr title="Gilbert">Gilb.</abbr> Foliot</cite>). Then they begin to
discuss what they have promised; the debate warms and lengthens;
Thomas, worn out with his three days’ struggle and seeing the rocks
ahead, begs for a respite till the morrow (<cite><abbr title="Herbert of Bosham">Herb. Bosh.</abbr></cite>). On that
morrow—<i>i.e.</i> January 16—Henry issues his commission to the
“elders,” and the council remains in abeyance till they are ready
with their report. None of our authorities tell us how long an
interval elapsed between the issue of the royal commission and
its report. Herbert, indeed, seems to imply that the discussion on
the constitutions began one night and the written report was brought
up next day. But this is only possible on the supposition that it
had been prepared secretly beforehand, of which none of the other
writers shew any suspicion. If the thing was not prepared beforehand,
it must have taken some time to do; and even if it was,
the king and the commissioners would surely, for the sake of appearances,
make a few days’ delay to give a shew of reality to their
investigations. Nine days is not too much to allow for preparation
of the report. On January 25, then, it is brought up, and the real
business of the council begins in earnest on the day named by <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Ralf de Diceto">R.
Diceto</abbr>. And if Thomas fought over every one of the sixteen constitutions
in the way of which Herbert gives us a specimen, six
days more may very well have been spent in the discussion, which
would thus end, as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Summa Causæ</i> says, on January 30.</p>

<span class="ch1">CHAPTER <abbr title="2">II.</abbr></span><br />

<span class="ch2">HENRY AND ROME.</span><br />

<span class="ch3">1164–1172.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">With</span> the archbishop’s flight into France the struggle
between him and the king entered upon a new phase. Its
intrinsic importance was almost entirely lost, and it became
simply an element in the wider questions of general
European politics. In England Thomas’s departure left
Henry sole master of the field; the Constitutions of
Clarendon were put in force without delay and without
difficulty; a year later they were followed up by an Assize,
significantly issued from the same place, which laid the
foundations of the whole later English system of procedure
in criminal causes; and thenceforth the work of legal and
judicial reform went on almost without a break, totally
unaffected by the strife which continued to rage between
king and primate for the next five years. The social
condition of the country was only indirectly affected by it.
The causes which had ostensibly given rise to it—the
principle involved in the acceptance or rejection of the
Constitutions—did not appeal strongly to the national
mind, and had already become obscured and subordinated
to the personal aspect which the quarrel had assumed at
Northampton. As in the case of Anselm, it was on this
personal aspect alone that popular feeling really fastened;
and in this point of view the advantage was strongly on the
archbishop’s side. Thomas, whose natural gifts had already
made him a sort of popular idol, was set by the high-handed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">ii.47</a></span>
proceedings of the council in the light of a victim of regal
tyranny; and the sweeping and cruel proscriptions inflicted
upon all who were in the remotest way connected with him
tended still further to excite popular sympathy for his
wrongs and turn it away from his persecutor. But the
sympathy was for the individual, not for the cause. The
principle of the clerical immunities had no hold upon the
minds of the people or even of the clergy at large. Even
among the archbishop’s own personal friends, almost the
only men who clave to it with anything like the same
ardour as himself were his two old comrades of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia Theobaldi</i>, Bishop John of Poitiers and John of Salisbury;
and even the devotion of John of Salisbury, which is one of
the brightest jewels in Becket’s crown, was really the
devotion of friend to friend, of Churchman to primate, of a
generous, chivalrous soul to what seemed the oppressed and
down-trodden side, rather than the devotion of a partizan to
party principle. Herbert of Bosham, the primate’s shadow
and second self, who clave to his side through good report
and evil report and looked upon him as a hero and a martyr
from first to last, was nevertheless the author of the famous
verdict which all the searching criticism of later times has
never yet been able to amend: “Both parties had a zeal for
God; which zeal was according to knowledge, His judgement
alone can determine.”<a id="Anchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 210.">[210]</a></p>

<p>Cool, dispassionate thinkers like Gilbert Foliot, on the
other hand, while inclining towards the cause which Thomas
had at heart, recoiled from his mode of upholding it as little
less than suicidal. In Gilbert’s view it was Thomas who
had betrayed those “rights of his order” which he proclaimed
so loudly, by forsaking the attitude of passive
resistance which the bishops had adopted at Westminster
and in which they were practically unassailable, and staking
everything upon the king’s good faith, without security, in
the meeting at Oxford and the council at Clarendon<span class="nobreak">:—</span>it
was Thomas who by his subsequent conduct—his rash<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">ii.48</a></span>
attempts at flight, his rapid changes of front at Northampton
in first admitting and then denying the royal jurisdiction,
his final insult to the king in coming to the council cross in
hand, and his undignified departure from the realm—had
frustrated the efforts whereby wiser and cooler heads might
have brought the king to a better mind and induced him to
withdraw the Constitutions<span class="nobreak">:—</span>and it was not Thomas, but
his suffragans, left to bear the brunt of a storm which they
had neither deserved nor provoked, who were really in a fair
way to become confessors and martyrs for a Church brought
into jeopardy by its own primate.<a id="Anchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 211.">[211]</a> Gilbert in fact saw
clearly that the importance of the point at issue between
king and archbishop was as nothing compared to the
disastrous consequences which must result from their protracted
strife. It threatened nothing less than ruin to the
intellectual and religious revival which Theobald had fostered
so carefully and so successfully. The best hopes of the
movement were bound up with the alliance between Church
and state which had been cemented at Henry’s accession;
that alliance was now destroyed; instead of the Church’s
most valuable fellow-worker, the king had been made her
bitter foe; and the work of revival was left to be carried on—if
it could be carried on at all—in the teeth of the royal
opposition and without a leader, while the man who should
have directed it was only a perpetual stumbling-block in the
path of those who had to supply as best they could the
place left deserted by his flight. It was upon Gilbert of
London that this burthen chiefly fell; and it is in Gilbert’s
position that we may find a key to the subsequent direction
of the controversy, as far as England was concerned.</p>

<p>For full twenty years before Becket’s rise to the primacy
Gilbert Foliot had been one of the most respected members
of the reforming party in the English Church. While
Thomas was a worldly young subdeacon in the household of
Archbishop Theobald, while as chancellor he was outshining the
king in luxurious splendour or riding in coat of mail at
the head of his troops, Gilbert was setting the pattern of
ecclesiastical discipline and furnishing the steadiest and most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">ii.49</a></span>
valued assistance to the primate’s schemes of reform.
Trained no less than Henry of Winchester in the old
Cluniac traditions of ecclesiastical authority, his credit had
never been shaken by rashness and inconsistency such as
had marred Henry’s labours; and it would have been neither
strange nor blameworthy if he had cherished a hope of
carrying on Theobald’s work as Theobald’s successor.
Gilbert, however, solemnly denied that he had ever sought
after or desired the primacy;<a id="Anchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 212.">[212]</a> and his conduct does not
seem to furnish any just ground for assuming the falsehood
of the denial. His opposition to the election of Thomas
was thoroughly consistent with his position and known
views; equally so was the support and co-operation which
Thomas, as soon as he was fairly launched into his new
course of action, anxiously sought to obtain from him, and
which he for a while steadily gave. He had begun to find
such co-operation difficult even before the question of the
clerical immunities arose at the council of Westminster. On
that question, in itself, the primate and the bishop of London
were at one; but they differed completely in their way of
treating it. To the impulsive, short-sighted, downright
Thomas it was the one, sole, all-absorbing question of life
and death; to the calm, far-seeing, cautious Gilbert it was
a provoking hindrance—raised up partly by the primate’s
own bad management—to the well-being of interests far
too serious and too wide-reaching to be imperilled for a
mere point of administrative detail. He took up his position
definitely at the council of Northampton. The customs
being once accepted, he held it the true Churchman’s duty
to obey them, to make the best and not the worst of them,
while desiring and labouring for their abrogation, but only
by pacific means. A temporary submission was the least of
two evils. It was infinitely safer to bend to the storm and
trust to the influences of time and conciliation for turning
the mind of the king, than to run the risk of driving him
into irreconcileable hostility to the Church. For hostility to
the Church meant something far worse now than in the days
when William Rufus and Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> had set up their regal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">ii.50</a></span>
authority against primate and Pope. It meant a widening
of the schism which was rending western Christendom in
twain; it meant the accession of the whole Angevin
dominions to the party of the Emperor and the anti-Pope,
and the severance of all the ties between the English Church
and her continental sisters which Theobald, Eugene and
Adrian had laboured so diligently to secure.</p>

<p>The dread of this catastrophe explains also the attitude
of the Pope. In the long dreary tale of negotiation and
intrigue which has to be traced through the maze of the
Becket correspondence, the most inconsistent and self-contradictory,
the most undecided and undignified, the most
unsatisfactory and disappointing part of all is that played
by Alexander <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> It is however only fair to remember
that, in this and in all like cases, the Pope’s part was also
the most difficult one. No crown in Christendom pressed
so sorely on its wearer’s brow as the triple tiara<span class="nobreak">:—</span>“It may
well look bright,” Adrian <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr> had been wont to say to his
friend John of Salisbury, “for it is a crown of fire!”
Adrian indeed, though his short reign was one of marked
vigour and prosperity, declared that if he had had any idea
of the thorns with which <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter’s chair was filled, he would
have begged his bread in England or remained buried in
the cloisters of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Rufus to the end of his days sooner than
thrust himself into such a thicket of troubles.<a id="Anchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 213.">[213]</a> For it was
not only “the care of all the churches” that rested upon a
medieval Pope, but the care of all the states as well. The
court of Rome had grown into the final court of appeal for
all Christendom; the Pope was expected to be the universal
referee, arbitrator and peacemaker of Europe, to hold the
balance between contending parties, to penetrate and disentangle
the intricacies of political situations which baffled
the skill of the most experienced diplomatists, to exercise a
sort of equitable jurisdiction on a vast scale over the whole
range of political as well as social life. Earlier and later
pontiffs may have voluntarily brought this burthen upon
themselves; most of the Popes of the twelfth century, at
any rate, seem to have groaned under it as a weight too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">ii.51</a></span>
heavy for any human strength to bear. Unprincipled as
their policy often seemed, there was not a little justice in
the view of John of Salisbury, that a position so exceptional
could not be brought within the scope of ordinary rules of
conduct, and that only those who had themselves felt its
difficulties could be really competent to judge it at all.<a id="Anchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 214.">[214]</a>
Adrian’s energetic spirit was worn out by it in four years;<a id="Anchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 215.">[215]</a>
yet his position was easy compared to that of Alexander
<abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> Alexander was a pontiff without a throne, the head of
a Church in captivity and exile; dependent on the support
of the most selfish and untrustworthy of living sovereigns;
with Italy and Germany arrayed against him under the rule
of a schismatic Emperor, and with the fidelity of the
Angevin house hanging upon a thread which the least
strain, the lightest touch, might break at any moment.
Moreover Alexander was no Englishman like his predecessor.
He had no inborn comprehension and no experience
of the ways and tempers of the north; he had no
bosom-friend, no John of Salisbury, to stand as interpreter
between him and the Angevin king or the English primate;
he understood neither of them, and he was almost equally
afraid of both. His chief anxiety was to have as little as
possible to do with them and their quarrel, and the fugitive
archbishop was to him anything but a welcome guest.</p>

<p>It was of course impossible for the Pope to withhold his
sympathy and his support from a prelate who came to him
as a confessor for the privileges of the Church. But it was
equally impossible for him to run the risk of driving Henry
and his dominions into schism by espousing Thomas’s cause
as decisively as Thomas himself desired. Placed thus in
what Adrian had once declared to be the ordinary position
of a Roman pontiff—“between hammer and anvil”—Alexander
drifted into a policy of shifts and contradictions, tergiversations
and double-dealings, which irritated Henry and
which Thomas simply failed to comprehend. If Gilbert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">ii.52</a></span>
Foliot and Arnulf of Lisieux could have succeeded in their
efforts to induce the contending parties to accept a compromise,
the Pope would have been only too glad to
sanction it. But it was useless to talk of compromise
where Thomas Becket was concerned. To all the remoter
consequences, the ultimate bearings of the quarrel, he was
totally blind. For him there was but one question in the
world, the one directly before him; it could have but two
sides, right and wrong, between which all adjustment was
impossible, and with which considerations of present expediency
or future consequences had nothing to do. All
Gilbert’s arguments for surrender, his solemn warnings of
the peril of schism, his pleadings that it was better for the
English Church to become for a while a sickly member of
the ecclesiastical body than to be cut off from it altogether,<a id="Anchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 216.">[216]</a>
Thomas looked upon, at best, as proposals for doing evil
that good might come. After his humiliating experience at
Clarendon he seems to have felt that he was no match for
Henry’s subtlety; his flight was evidently caused chiefly by
dread of being again entrapped into a betrayal of what he
held to be his duty; and once, in an agony of self-reproach
and self-distrust, he laid his archiepiscopal ring at the
Pope’s feet and prayed to be released from the burthen of
an office for which he felt himself unworthy and unfit.<a id="Anchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 217.">[217]</a>
Strong as was the temptation to pacify Henry thus easily,
Alexander felt that the Church could not allow such a
sacrifice of her champion; and Thomas never again swerved
from his determination to be satisfied with nothing short of
complete surrender on the part of the king. For this one
object he laboured, pleaded, argued, censured, during the
next six years without ceasing; his own suffragans, the
monastic orders, Pope, cardinals, the Empress Matilda, the
king of France, none of them had a moment’s peace from
his passionate endeavours to press them into a service which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">ii.53</a></span>
he seemed to expect them all to regard as a matter of life
and death not merely for England but for all Christendom.
Doubtless it was a sad waste of energy and a sad perversion
of enthusiasm; yet the enthusiasm contrasts pathetically,
almost heroically, with the spirit in which it was met.
There was something noble, if there was also something
exasperatingly unpractical, in a man who, absorbed in his
devotion to one mistaken idea, never even saw that he and
his cause were becoming the pretexts and the tools of half
the political intrigues of Europe, and whom the experience
of a lifetime failed to teach that all the world was not as
single-hearted as himself. Intellectually, a mind thus constituted
must needs provoke and deserve the impatient scorn
of a cool clear brain such as Gilbert Foliot’s; but its very
intellectual weakness was the source of its true strength. It
is this dogged adherence to one fixed idea, this simplicity
of aim, which appeals to the average crowd of mankind far
more strongly than the larger and more statesmanlike
temper of men like Foliot, or like Henry himself. Whether
or no the cause be worthy—whether or no the zeal be
according to knowledge—it is the zealot, not the philosopher,
who becomes the popular hero and martyr.</p>

<p>From the moment of Thomas’s arrival in France, then,
little though he perceived it himself, the direct question at
issue between him and the king became in every point of
view save his own entirely subordinate to the indirect consequences
of their quarrel; the ecclesiastical interest became
secondary to the political, which involved matters of grave
importance to all Europe. The one person to whom the
archbishop’s flight was most thoroughly welcome was Louis
of France. Louis and Henry were nominally at peace; but
to Louis their alliance was simply a shield behind which he
could plan without danger his schemes for undermining
Henry’s power on the continent, and no better tool for this
purpose could possibly have fallen into his hands than the
fugitive archbishop of Canterbury. Thomas had indeed just
enough perception of the state of affairs between the two
kings—of which he must have acquired considerable experience
in his chancellor days—to choose going to live on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">ii.54</a></span>
own resources at Pontigny rather than accept the hospitality
of his sovereign’s enemy.<a id="Anchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 218.">[218]</a> This arrangement probably
delighted Louis, for it furnished him with a safe answer to
Henry’s complaints and remonstrances about harbouring the
“traitor”—Thomas was in sanctuary in a Cistercian abbey
in Burgundy, and France was not harbouring him at all;
while the welcome which Louis gave to the primate’s exiled
friends and the sympathy which he displayed for their cause
heightened his own reputation for devotion to the Church
and served as a foil to set off more conspicuously the supposed
hostility of Henry. To Louis in short the quarrel was something
which might turn to his own advantage by helping to
bring Henry into difficulties; and he used it accordingly
with a skill peculiar to himself, making a great shew of disinterested
zeal and friendly mediation, and all the while
taking care that the breach should be kept open till its healing
was required for his own interest.</p>

<p>With such an onlooker as this Henry knew that he must
play his game with the utmost caution. He had been provoked
by the personal opposition of his old friend into
standing upon his regal dignity more stiffly than he would
have thought it worth while to do so long as it remained
unchallenged. On his side, too, there was a principle at
stake, and he could not give it up unconditionally; but he
might have been induced to accept a compromise, had not
the obstinacy of Thomas forced him into a corresponding
attitude of unbending determination. So keen was his sense
of the danger attendant upon the fugitive archbishop’s
presence in France that it led him to postpone once more
the work which he had been planning in England and cross
over to Normandy again early in 1165.<a id="Anchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 219.">[219]</a> Lent was passed
in fruitless attempts to bring about a triple conference
between the two kings and the Pope; Henry refused to
allow Thomas to be present; Thomas begged the Pope not
to expose himself to Henry’s wiles without him who alone
could help him to see through them; and Alexander, now
busy with preparations for his return to Rome, was probably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">ii.55</a></span>
not sorry to escape by declaring that for a temporal prince
to dictate who should or who should not form part of the
Pope’s suite was a claim which had never been heard of
before and which he could not possibly admit.<a id="Anchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 220.">[220]</a> Immediately
after Easter he set out on his journey homewards.</p>

<p>The rival party saw their opportunity and seized it
without delay. Their fortunes were now at a very low ebb;
the antipope Victor had died in April; his chief supporter,
Cardinal Guy of Crema, had succeeded him under the title
of Paschal <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>; but Italy had cast him off, and even in
Germany the tide was turning against him. The Emperor,
however, clung with unwavering determination to his original
policy; and he at once saw in the English king’s quarrel
with the Church a means of gaining for Paschal’s cause what
would amply compensate for all that had been lost. Before
Alexander was fairly out of the French kingdom an embassy
from Germany came to Henry at Rouen, bringing proposals
for an alliance to be secured by two marriages: one between
the English princess Matilda, Henry’s eldest daughter, and
the Emperor’s cousin Duke Henry of Saxony; the other
between Henry’s second daughter and Frederic’s own little
son. The chief ambassador was Reginald, archbishop-elect
of Cöln, who from the time of Frederic’s accession—two
years before that of Henry—had been his chancellor and
confidential adviser, playing a part curiously like that of
Thomas Becket, till in the very year of the English chancellor’s
removal to Canterbury he was appointed to the see
of Cöln. There the parallel with Thomas ended; for
Reginald was the most extreme champion of the privileges
not of the Church but of the Imperial Crown, and was even
more closely identified with the schismatic party than
Frederic himself. Henry sent him over to the queen, who
had been left as regent in England, to receive from her a
formal promise of her daughter’s hand to the duke of Saxony,
in a great council convened at Westminster for that purpose.
The old justiciar Earl Robert of Leicester refused the kiss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">ii.56</a></span>
of peace to the schismatic and caused the altars at which he
had celebrated to be thrown down,<a id="Anchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 221.">[221]</a> thereby saving Henry
from the fatal blunder of committing himself publicly to the
cause of the anti-pope, and England from the dangers of
open schism. But he could not prevent the king from
sending two clerks to a council which met at Würzburg on
Whit-Sunday to abjure Pope Alexander and acknowledge
Paschal; and although the fact was strenuously denied, it
seems impossible to doubt that they did take the oath at
the Emperor’s hands in their master’s name;<a id="Anchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 222.">[222]</a> indeed,
Reginald of Cöln boasted that Henry had promised to make
all the bishops in his dominions do the same.</p>

<p>A crisis seemed imminent, but Henry managed to avoid
it. From the Emperor’s solicitations, from the Pope’s
remonstrances, from all the pleadings of friends and all the
intrigues of foes, he suddenly made his escape by flying back
to England and plunging into a Welsh war which kept him
all the summer safe out of their reach,<a id="Anchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 223.">[223]</a> and furnished him
with an excuse for postponing indefinitely the completion of
his alliance with the schismatic party. Such an alliance
would in fact have cost far more than it was worth. Alexander
was once more safely seated upon <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter’s chair, and
was urging Thomas to throw himself wholly on the protection
of the king of France; Louis was in the highest state of
triumph, rejoicing over the birth of his long-desired son;
while the whole Angevin dominions, which Eleanor was
governing in her husband’s absence, were full of suppressed
disaffection and surrounded with threatening or intriguing
foes.<a id="Anchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 224.">[224]</a> In Lent 1166 therefore Henry hurried back to Normandy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">ii.57</a></span>
to hold a conference with Louis, and, if possible, to
free his own hands for the work which lay before him.</p>

<p>The work was in truth a vast and complex one. At
the age of thirty-three Henry was already planning out an
elaborate scheme for the future of his children and the distribution
of his territories, in which the election of his eldest
son as joint-king in England was but the first and least
difficult step. Normandy and Anjou, as well as England,
had to be secured for little Henry; Aquitaine was if possible
to be settled upon Richard as his mother’s heir; for Geoffrey
Henry was bent upon acquiring the Breton duchy.<a id="Anchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 225.">[225]</a> Conan
<abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr>, whom Henry had in 1158 established as duke of
Britanny, had but one child, a daughter, whose hand, together
with the reversion of her father’s territories, the king was
anxious to secure for his son. This however required the
assent not only of Conan but of Louis of France, and also
of the Breton barons, who bitterly resented the Norman
interference which had set Conan as ruler over them, and
were inclined to resist to the uttermost an arrangement
which would bring them still more directly under the Norman
yoke; while Louis was but too ready to encourage
them in their resistance. A campaign in the summer of
1166, however, another in August 1167, and a third in the
following spring so far broke their opposition<a id="Anchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 226.">[226]</a> that in May<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">ii.58</a></span>
1169 Geoffrey was sent into Britanny to receive their
homage as heir to the dukedom; three months later his
father joined him,<a id="Anchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 227.">[227]</a> and at Christmas they held their court
together at Nantes,<a id="Anchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 228.">[228]</a> whence they made a sort of triumphal
progress through the duchy, receiving homage and fealty
wherever they went.<a id="Anchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 229.">[229]</a></p>

According to this writer, one of the Breton leaders—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arturi dapifer,
Rollandus, consul et idem tunc Britonum</span>” (Mr. Howlett suggests that this may
be Roland of Dinan,
    <cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 696 note)</cite>
—wrote a letter to Arthur imploring his aid
for Britanny, and received a reassuring answer; Henry also received a long epistle
from the blameless king, to which, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">subridens sociis, nil pavefactus</span>,”
    (<cite><abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 21, <abbr title="5">v.</abbr> 1218, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 705</cite>)
he returned a polite and diplomatic answer. Unluckily the good
monk omits to say how the letters were conveyed, and gives us no light upon the
postal arrangements between Britanny and Avalon—which by the way he places
among “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">silvas <span class="dots">...</span> Cornubiæ, proxima castra loco</span>,” whatever that may mean
    (<cite><abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 20, <abbr title="verses">vv.</abbr> 1213, 1214, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 705</cite>).
It is quite possible that some of the Breton
leaders did seek to rouse the spirit of their followers by publishing an imaginary
correspondence with the mythic hero-king whose existence was to most of the
common people in Britanny at that time almost as much an article of faith as any
in the Creed; it is possible too that they were themselves so far carried away by
the same illusion as to attempt to work upon Henry by similar means; and in
that case it is extremely probable that Henry, with his Angevin tact and sense of
humour, would meet the appeal pretty much as the Bec writer represents. But
the letters given in the <i>Draco</i> must be the monk’s own composition. Neither
Roland nor Henry can have been capable of stringing together such a quantity of
pseudo-history, ancient and modern, as is therein contained.

<p>It had proved easier to subdue Britanny than to hold
Aquitaine. The half independent princes of the south, so
scornful of a king beyond the Loire, were at least equally
scornful of a king from beyond the sea; in November 1166
Henry was obliged to summon them to a conference at
Chinon,<a id="Anchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 230.">[230]</a> and to relieve Eleanor of her task of government
by sending her to keep Christmas in England,<a id="Anchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 231.">[231]</a> while he
himself took her place at Poitiers.<a id="Anchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 232.">[232]</a> His foes seized their
opportunity to revive the vexed question of Toulouse; a
meeting with Raymond at Grandmont and an attempt to

led to a fresh rupture with Louis;<a id="Anchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 233.">[233]</a> and in the spring of
1168 the discontented barons of Aquitaine, secure of the
French king’s goodwill, broke into open revolt. In the
midst of a negotiation with Louis, Henry hurried away to
subdue them.<a id="Anchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 234.">[234]</a> Scarcely had he turned northward again
when Earl Patrick of Salisbury, whom he had appointed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">ii.59</a></span>

Scottish and Welsh,<a id="Anchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 236.">[236]</a> as well as of the exiled archbishop.</p>

This last
writer states that the slayer was Guy of Lusignan, and that Guy fled to Jerusalem
(of which he afterwards became king) to escape the punishment of this crime.
This story has been generally adopted by modern historians. But its latter half
is incompatible with the appearance of “Guy of Lusignan” among the rebels in
Aquitaine in 1173, five years after the death of Patrick
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Gesta Henrici">Gesta Hen.</abbr></i>, Stubbs, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 46)</cite>;
and the whole of it seems to rest solely on Roger’s misunderstanding of
the passage in the

as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Guido de Lezinan, frater Gaufridi de Lezinan, qui Patricium comitem

Roger of Howden chose to make <em>qui</em> refer to <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Guido</em>; but it
might just as well, or even better, refer to <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gaufridus</em>. Guy comes upon the historical
scene for the first time in 1173. It seems pretty clear that Geoffrey was his elder
brother, and took a leading part in southern politics and warfare long before Guy
was of an age to join in them. If Patrick was slain by either of the brothers,
therefore, it was by Geoffrey and not by Guy. Admitting this much, however,
there is still no ground for looking upon even Geoffrey as a murderer who had
committed such a crime as to be obliged to fly from justice. For “Geoffrey of
Lusignan” stood by the side of Guy among the rebels of 1173
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Gesta Henrici">Gesta Hen.</abbr></i>, Stubbs, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 46</cite>);
“Geoffrey of Lusignan” and his brothers claimed La Marche
against King Henry between 1178 and 1180
    (<cite><abbr title="Geoffrey">Geoff.</abbr> Vigeois, <abbr title="book 1">l. i.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 70, Labbe,
<i><abbr title="Nova Bibliotheca" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nova Biblioth.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 324</cite>);
“Geoffrey of Lusignan” rose against Richard in
1188
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Gesta Henrici">Gesta Hen.</abbr></i>, Stubbs, <abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 34</cite>;

and it was not till after he had in this
revolt slain a special friend of Richard, that he betook himself to Palestine, where
he arrived in the summer of the same year
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Itinerarium Regis Ricardi">Itin. Reg. Ric.</abbr></i>, Stubbs, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 26)</cite>,
and where,
moreover, he and Richard afterwards became firm allies. Geoffrey may therefore
enjoy the benefit of the plea which Bishop Stubbs (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Itinerarium Regis Ricardi">Itin. Reg. Ric.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="introduction">introd.</abbr> <abbr title="page 124">p.
cxxiv</abbr>, note) puts forward for Guy, that “there is nothing to show that Patrick
was not killed in fair fight.” But it seems pretty clear that for the heroic king of
Jerusalem himself no such plea is needed at all.

and the jurisconsults of Bologna;<a id="Anchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 241.">[241]</a> and on the other,

<p>All this political, ecclesiastical and diplomatic coil Henry
had to unravel almost single-handed. Of the group of counsellors
who had stood around him in his early years, Arnulf
of Lisieux on one side of the sea and Richard de Lucy on
the other were almost the sole survivors. He had lost the
services of his constable Henry of Essex under very painful
circumstances a few months before that council at Woodstock
which saw the beginning of his quarrel with Thomas.
The constable was accused by Robert de Montfort of having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">ii.61</a></span>
committed high treason six years before by purposely letting
fall the standard and falsely proclaiming the king’s death at
the battle of Consilt. Henry of Essex declared that he
had dropped the standard in the paralysis of despair, really
believing the king to be dead; and it is evident from the
high commands which he held in the war of Toulouse and
elsewhere that the king continued to treat him with undiminished
confidence, and to regard him as one of his most
valuable ministers and friends. The charge once made,
however, could only be met by ordeal of battle. The
encounter took place at Reading; Henry of Essex went
down before his accuser’s lance; and all that his sovereign
could do for him was to save his life by letting the monks
of the neighbouring abbey carry his body off the field as if
for burial, and when he proved to be still alive, suffering
him to remain as a brother of the house, while his property
was confiscated to the Crown and his services were lost to
the state.<a id="Anchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 243.">[243]</a> The king’s mother died in the autumn of 1167;<a id="Anchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 244.">[244]</a>

<p>One thing alone was now lacking to the completion of
Henry’s scheme: the crowning of his heir. There can be
no doubt that when he sent Thomas and the child to England
together—the one to be chosen king and the other to
be made primate—he intended the coronation to take place
as soon as he himself could rejoin them. Its performance,
delayed by his own continued absence on the continent, had
however been made impossible by his quarrel with Thomas.
That the archbishop of Canterbury alone could lawfully
crown a king of England was a constitutional as well as an
ecclesiastical tradition so deeply rooted in the minds of
Englishmen that nothing short of absolute necessity had
induced Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> to set it aside in his own case; and still
less could Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> venture to risk such an innovation in
the case of his son.<a id="Anchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 254.">[254]</a> Yet the prospect of a reconciliation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">ii.63</a></span>
with the primate seemed at this moment further off than
ever.</p>

<p>Thomas’s first impulse on entering Pontigny had been
to give himself up to a course of study, devotion and self-discipline
more severe than anything which he had yet
attempted. He secretly assumed the habit of the “white
monks,”<a id="Anchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 255.">[255]</a> and nearly ruined his delicate constitution by a
rash endeavour to practise the rigorous abstinence enjoined
by the rules of the order.<a id="Anchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 256.">[256]</a> He grew more diligent than
ever in prayer, meditation, and study of Holy Scripture.<a id="Anchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 257.">[257]</a>
But his restless, impetuous nature could not rise to the
serene heights of more than worldly wisdom urged upon
him by John of Salisbury, who truly insisted that such
occupations alone were worthy of a true confessor.<a id="Anchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 258.">[258]</a> In spite
of John’s warnings and pleadings, he still kept all his friends—John
himself included—ceaselessly at work in his behalf;
and while he sought out in every church and convent in
Gaul every rare and valuable book that he could hear of, to
be copied for his cathedral library, he was also raking
together for the same collection all the privileges, old or
new, that could be disinterred from the Roman archives or
extorted from the favour of the Pope.<a id="Anchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 259.">[259]</a> Until Easter 1166
Alexander restrained him from any direct measures against
the king;<a id="Anchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 260.">[260]</a> then, unable to keep silence any longer, Thomas
again took the matter into his own hands and wrote to
Henry himself, earnestly imploring him to consider his ways
and to grant his old friend a personal interview.<a id="Anchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 261.">[261]</a> Henry
was inexorable; Thomas wrote again, this time a torrent of
mingled warnings, intreaties and remonstrances,<a id="Anchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 262.">[262]</a> and with
just as little effect. Then, towards the end of May, as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">ii.64</a></span>
king was holding council with his barons at Chinon, a barefooted
monk came to him with a third letter from the
primate.<a id="Anchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 263.">[263]</a> Once again Thomas expressed his longing for a
personal meeting; once again he set forth the doctrine of
the divine rights and duties of kings, and charged Henry, by
the solemn memory of his coronation-vows, to restore to
the English Church her privileges and her chief pastor.
Only in the last sentence came a significant warning: “If
not, then know of a surety that you shall feel the severity of
Divine vengeance!”<a id="Anchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 264.">[264]</a> And there was no doubt about its
meaning; for the Empress Matilda had already transmitted
to her son a threat sent to her by Thomas in plain words,
that unless she could bring him to acknowledge his error,
“shortly, yea, very shortly” the “sword of the Spirit”
should be drawn against his dominions and even against
himself.<a id="Anchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 265.">[265]</a></p>

<p>Harassed by disaster and revolt, provoked by the
primate’s former letters, Henry, upon reading this one and
hearing the messenger’s comment upon it—for Thomas had
charged him to say a good deal more than he wrote<a id="Anchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 266.">[266]</a>—might
well feel that he was standing on the brink of a
volcano. He turned desperately upon the bishops around
him, half imploring, half commanding them to help him out
of his strait, abusing them for a pack of traitors who would
not trouble themselves to rid him of this one unmanageable
foe, and exclaiming with a burst of tears that the archbishop
was destroying him soul and body together; for he naturally
expected nothing less than an interdict on his dominions
and an anathema against himself, and both sanctioned by
the Pope. When Henry was thus at his wits’ end, the only
one among his continental advisers who was likely to have
any counsel to offer him was Arnulf of Lisieux. Once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">ii.65</a></span>
more Arnulf proved equal to the occasion; he suggested
that the primate’s intended censures should be forestalled by
an appeal to the Pope. The remedy was a desperate one,
for, as John of Salisbury triumphantly remarked when he
heard of it, the king was flying in the face of his own
Constitutions and confirming that very right of appeal
which he was so anxious to abolish, by thus having
recourse to it for his own protection. But there was no
other loophole of escape; so the appeal was made, a
messenger was despatched to give notice of it in England,
close the ports and cut off all communication with Thomas
and with the Pope; while the bishops of Lisieux and Séez
set out for Pontigny to bid the primate stay his hand till
the octave of Easter next, which was fixed for the term
of Henry’s appeal.<a id="Anchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 267.">[267]</a></p>

<p>They were too late. No sooner had the barefooted
messenger returned with his tidings of the king’s irreconcileable
wrath than Thomas hurried to Soissons on a pilgrimage
to its three famous shrines<span class="nobreak">:—</span>those of the Blessed Virgin,
who had been the object of his special reverence ever since
he learned the Ave Maria at his mother’s knee; of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Gregory the Great, the patron of the whole English Church
and more particularly of Canterbury and its archbishops;
and of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Drausius, who was believed to have the power of
rendering invincible any champion who spent a night in
prayer before his relics. Before each of these shrines
Thomas, like a warrior preparing for mortal combat, passed
a night in solemn vigil, the last night being that of the
festival of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Drausius, and also of Ascension-day.<a id="Anchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 268.">[268]</a> On the
morrow he left Soissons;<a id="Anchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 269.">[269]</a> on Whitsun-eve<a id="Anchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 270.">[270]</a> he reached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">ii.66</a></span>
Vézelay, a little town distant only a day’s journey from
Pontigny, and made famous by its great abbey, which
boasted of possessing the body of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary Magdalene.
Thomas found the place crowded with pilgrims assembled
to keep the Whitsun feast on this venerated spot. He was
invited by the abbot to celebrate High Mass and preach on
the festival day;<a id="Anchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 271.">[271]</a> his sermon ended, he solemnly anathematized
the royal customs and all their upholders, and excommunicated
by name seven persons whom he denounced as
special enemies to the Church; the two first being Henry’s
confidential envoys John of Oxford and Richard of Ilchester,
who had been the medium of his communications with the
Emperor; while a third, Jocelyn de Bailleul, was one of his
chief advisers, and a fourth was no less a personage than
the justiciar, Richard de Lucy.<a id="Anchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 272.">[272]</a> Thomas had set out from
Soissons in the full determination to excommunicate Henry
himself at the same time; but on his way he learned that
the king was dangerously ill; he therefore contented himself
with a solemn warning publicly addressed to him by
name, calling him to repentance for the last time, and in
default, threatening him with immediate excommunication.<a id="Anchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 273.">[273]</a></p>

<p>The news of these proceedings reached Henry when,
sick and anxious, he was trying to gather up strength and
energy for a campaign against the Bretons. He instantly
despatched another messenger to England, bidding Richard
de Lucy call an assembly of the bishops and clergy and
compel them to make a general appeal to the Pope against
the authority and jurisdiction of their primate.<a id="Anchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 274.">[274]</a> The meeting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">ii.67</a></span>
was held in London<a id="Anchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 275.">[275]</a> at midsummer.<a id="Anchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 276.">[276]</a> The appeal was
made and sent to the Pope in the name of all the bishops
and clergy of England; but it is tolerably clear that the
main body were merely passive followers, more or less
willing, of Gilbert of London and Jocelyn of Salisbury, the
former of whom was almost certainly the writer of the letter
which conveyed the appeal to the Pope, as well as of that
which announced it to the primate.<a id="Anchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 277.">[277]</a> The hand of Gilbert
Foliot was indeed so plainly visible that Thomas’s reply was
addressed with equal plainness to him personally.<a id="Anchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 278.">[278]</a> The
long and sarcastic letter with which he retorted<a id="Anchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 279.">[279]</a> was answered
in a yet more startling fashion at the opening of the next
year. As Gilbert stood before the high altar of his cathedral
church on the feast of its patron saint a paper was
thrust into his hand; to his dismay it proved to be a papal
brief granting to Archbishop Thomas a commission as legate
for all England, and commanding the bishops to render
him unqualified obedience and to resign within two months
whatever confiscated church property had been placed in
their charge by the king. In an agony of distress Gilbert,
who himself had the custody of the Canterbury estates, sent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">ii.68</a></span>
this news to the king, imploring him to grant permission
that the Pope’s mandate might be obeyed, at least till some
method could be devised for escaping from a dilemma which
now looked well-nigh hopeless.<a id="Anchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 280.">[280]</a> Henry, absorbed in a
struggle with the Bretons, had already been provoked into
a vengeance as impolitic as it was mean. He threatened
the Cistercian abbots assembled on Holy Cross day at the
general chapter of their order that if Thomas were not
immediately expelled from Pontigny, he would send all the
White Monks in his dominions to share the primate’s exile.<a id="Anchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 281.">[281]</a>
When the abbot of Pontigny carried this message home,
Thomas could only bid him farewell and betake himself to
the sole protection left him—that of the king of France. He
left Pontigny on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin’s day<a id="Anchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 282.">[282]</a> 1166, and took up his abode
as the guest of Louis in the abbey of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Columba at Sens.<a id="Anchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 283.">[283]</a></p>

The bishop of Exeter consented to
appeal, but in a fashion of his own, of which however there is no trace in the
letter actually sent to the Pope. Two prelates were absent: Walter of Rochester,
who pleaded illness, and Henry of Winchester, who wrote in excuse: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vocatus a
summo Pontifice, nec appello nec appellare volo.</span>” The others thought he meant
that the Pope had cited him; “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipse vero summum Pontificem, summum Judicem
intelligebat, ad cujus tribunal jamjam trahebatur examinandus, tanquam qui in
multis diebus processerat et vitæ metis appropinquaret</span>.” So says
    <cite><abbr title="William of Canterbury">Will. Cant.</abbr></cite>;
but John of Salisbury says distinctly that the letter of appeal was sealed by London,
<em>Winchester</em> and Hereford
    (<cite><abbr title="Epistle 252">Ep. cclii.</abbr>, Robertson, <i>Becket</i>, <abbr title="volume 6">vol. vi.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 65</cite>).
Can William
have founded his pretty story on the old confusion (which is perpetually breaking
out in his favourite authority, Garnier, and in other writers who have less excuse
for it) between <em>Wincestre</em> and <em>Wirecestre</em>—and was Roger of Worcester the real
absentee? He certainly did not share in the obloquy which this appeal brought
upon Robert of Hereford, with whom hitherto he had usually been coupled by
Thomas; on the contrary, he and Bartholomew of Exeter are henceforth always
coupled together as fellow-sufferers for their loyalty to the primate.

it is dated “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anagniæ, vii. Idus Octobris</span>,” but its
true date is Easter-day, April 24 (see
    <cite>editor’s note, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 329</cite>)
—the actual date of the letter whereby Alexander notified his act to the English bishops;
    <cite><abbr title="Epistle 173">Ep. clxxiii.</abbr> (Robertson, as above, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 229–231)</cite>.
The diocese (not the province) of York was
exempted from Thomas’s legatine jurisdiction—the reason being that Roger of
York was legate for Scotland
    (<cite><abbr title="Epistle 270">Ep. cclxx.</abbr>, <i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="volume 6">vol. vi.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 119</cite>).
Thomas sent the
brief over to his friends Robert of Hereford and Roger of Worcester, bidding them
communicate it to their brethren, beginning with London
    (<cite><abbr title="Epistle 179">Ep. clxxix.</abbr>, <i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="volume 5">vol. v.</abbr>
<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 344–346)</cite>.
Canon Robertson supposes this brief to have been delivered to
Gilbert on the feast of the Commemoration of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Paul, <i>i.e.</i> June 30, 1166. Gilbert
himself says merely “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">die beati Pauli</span>”; and his letter has no date. But it mentions
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">legatos qui diriguntur ad nos</span>”; and there is no hint elsewhere of any talk
about sending legates till late in the autumn, or even winter. There really seems
to be no reason why we should not adopt a more obvious rendering of the date,
as representing the greater and better-known festival of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Paul’s Conversion. In
that case, of course, the year must be 1167.

<p>Henry saw his own blunder as soon as it was made, and
endeavoured to neutralize its effects by despatching an
embassy to the Pope, requesting that he would send a
legatine commission to settle the controversy. One of his
envoys was the excommunicate John of Oxford; to the
horror of Thomas and the indignation of Louis, John came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">ii.69</a></span>
back in triumph, boasting not only that he had been
absolved by the Pope, but that two cardinals, William and
Otto—the former of whom was a determined opponent of
Thomas—were coming with full powers to sit in judgement
on the case between primate and king and decide it without
appeal.<a id="Anchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 284.">[284]</a> The first half of the boast was true, but not the
second; the cautious Pope instructed his envoys to do
nothing more than arbitrate between the contending parties,
if they could.<a id="Anchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 285.">[285]</a> They did not reach Normandy till the
autumn of 1167; Thomas came to meet them on the

any negotiations till the property of the metropolitan see
was restored;<a id="Anchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 286.">[286]</a> the legates carried their report to the king
at Argentan, and were dismissed with an exclamation of

upon a cardinal again!”<a id="Anchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 287.">[287]</a> Five of the English bishops whom

<p>At last, when the two kings made their treaty at Montmirail
at Epiphany 1169, Thomas, who had come to the
spot under the protection of Louis, suddenly entered the
royal presence and fell at Henry’s feet, offering to place
himself unreservedly in his hands. All parties thought the
struggle was over, till the archbishop added once again the
words which had so exasperated Henry at Oxford and at
Clarendon: “Saving God’s honour and my order.” The
king burst into a fury, and the meeting broke up in confusion.<a id="Anchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 290.">[290]</a>
Three months later, on Palm Sunday, from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">ii.70</a></span>
high altar of Clairvaux, Thomas excommunicated ten of his
opponents, first among whom was Gilbert Foliot.<a id="Anchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 291.">[291]</a> Gilbert,
who knew that the sentence had been hanging over him
for more than a year, had appealed against it before it was
uttered;<a id="Anchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 292.">[292]</a> the king, too, was forewarned, and at every seaport
guards were set to catch and punish with the utmost
rigour any messenger from the primate. It was not till
Ascension-day that a young layman named Berengar
made his way up to the altar of Gilbert’s cathedral
church in the middle of High Mass and thrust into the
hand of the celebrant the archbishop’s letter proclaiming
the excommunication of the bishop.<a id="Anchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 293.">[293]</a> On that very
day Thomas issued another string of excommunications.<a id="Anchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 294.">[294]</a>
Gilbert, driven to extremity, renewed his appeal two days
later; and he added to it a formal refusal to acknowledge
the jurisdiction of a metropolitan to whom he had made no
profession, and a declaration—so at least it was reported in
Gaul—of his intention to claim the metropolitical dignity
for his own see, as an ancient right of which it had been
unjustly defrauded by Canterbury.<a id="Anchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 295.">[295]</a> A storm of indignant
protest and vehement denunciation arose from the archbishop’s
party; and the terrified Pope checked further proceedings
by despatching another pair of envoys, who as
usual failed to agree either with the king, with the archbishop,
or even with each other, and after wasting the summer in
misunderstandings and recriminations left the case just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">ii.71</a></span>
where they had found it.<a id="Anchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 296.">[296]</a> By this time king and primate
were both weary of their quarrel, and still more weary of
mediation. In November they had another personal
interview at Montmartre, and the archbishop’s unconditional
restoration was all but decided.<a id="Anchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 297.">[297]</a> Thomas, however,
rashly attempted to hasten the completion of the settlement
by a threat of interdict;<a id="Anchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 298.">[298]</a> and the threat stung Henry into
an act of far greater rashness. He had met Louis, as well
as Thomas, at Montmartre, and had gained his immediate
object of restraining the French king yet a little longer from
direct hostilities; the settlement of Britanny was completed
at Christmas, that of Aquitaine was so far secure that its
conclusion might safely be left to Eleanor’s care; in March
1170 Henry went to England<a id="Anchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 299.">[299]</a> with the fixed determination
of seeing his eldest son crowned there before he left it
again.</p>

—a very circumstantial account, yet one can
scarcely understand how a man so wise and so learned as Gilbert can really have
made such an utterly unhistorical claim. He must have known that it had no
shadow of foundation, the nearest approach to such a thing being <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Gregory’s
abortive scheme for fixing the two archbishoprics at London and York. Gilbert’s
opponents, on the other hand, declared that he derived his claim from the archpriests
of Jupiter who had their seat in the Roman Londinium, and denounced him as their
would-be representative and successor.

<p>Three years before, he had wrung from the Pope—then
blockaded in Rome by the Imperial troops, and in the last
extremity of peril—a brief authorizing young Henry’s
coronation by the archbishop of York, in default of the
absent primate of all England.<a id="Anchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 300.">[300]</a> In face of a mass of
earlier and later rescripts from Alexander’s predecessors and
Alexander himself, all strenuously confirming the exclusive
privileges of Canterbury, Henry had never yet ventured to
make use of this document; like Adrian’s bull for the conquest
of Ireland, it had been kept in reserve for a future
day; and that day had now come. In vain did Thomas
proclaim his threatened interdict;<a id="Anchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 301.">[301]</a> in vain did the Pope<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">ii.72</a></span>
ratify it;<a id="Anchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 302.">[302]</a> in vain did both alike issue prohibitions to all the
English bishops against the act which they knew to be in
contemplation.<a id="Anchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 303.">[303]</a> The vigilance of the justiciars, quickened
by a fresh set of stringent injunctions sent over by the king
in the previous autumn,<a id="Anchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 304.">[304]</a> made the delivery of letters from
either primate or Pope so difficult that Thomas at last could
intrust it to no one but a nun, Idonea, whom he solemnly
charged with the duty of presenting to Roger of York the
papal brief in which the coronation was forbidden.<a id="Anchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 305.">[305]</a> The
ceremony was fixed for Sunday, June 14. A week before
that date young Henry, who with his girl-bride Margaret of
France had been left at Caen under the care of his mother
and Richard of Hommet the constable of Normandy, was
summoned to join his father in England.<a id="Anchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 306.">[306]</a> On <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Barnabas’s

the Pope’s letter was at last forced upon the archbishop of
York;<a id="Anchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 308.">[308]</a> but none the less did he on the following morning
crown and anoint young Henry in Westminster abbey; while
Gilbert of London, who had managed to extort conditional
absolution in the Pope’s name from Archbishop Rotrou of
Rouen,<a id="Anchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 309.">[309]</a> once more stood openly by his side in the foremost

<p>The elder king only waited to see the tenants-in-chief,

meet the fast-gathering storm.<a id="Anchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 311.">[311]</a> Louis, incensed that his
daughter’s husband should have been crowned without her,
was already threatening war;<a id="Anchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 312.">[312]</a> Thomas, seeing in the king’s
action nothing but the climax of Canterbury’s wrongs, was
overwhelming the Pope with complaints, reproaches, and
intreaties for summary vengeance upon all who had taken
part in the coronation; and the majority of the cardinals
strongly supported his demands.<a id="Anchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 313.">[313]</a> Henry saw that he must
make peace at any price. Two days before the feast of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Mary Magdalene he held a conference with Louis near
Fréteval, on the borders of the Vendômois and the county
of Chartres;<a id="Anchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 314.">[314]</a> they were reconciled, and as they parted
Henry said jestingly to the French king: “That rascal of
yours, too, shall have his peace to-morrow; and a right good
peace shall it be.”<a id="Anchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 315.">[315]</a> At dawn on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary Magalene’s day<a id="Anchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 316.">[316]</a>
he met Thomas in the “Traitor’s Meadow,”<a id="Anchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 317.">[317]</a> close to
Fréteval; they rode apart together, and remained in conference
so long that the patience of their followers was all but
exhausted, when at last Thomas was seen to dismount and
throw himself at the king’s feet. Henry sprang from his
horse, raised the archbishop from the ground, held his
stirrup while he remounted, and rode back to tell his
followers that peace was made, on terms which practically
amounted to a complete mutual amnesty and a return to
the state of affairs which had existed before the quarrel.<a id="Anchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 318.">[318]</a></p>

<p>Henry had no sooner returned to Normandy than he
fell sick almost to death; on his recovery he went on a
pilgrimage to the shrine of our Lady at Rocamadour in the
Quercy,<a id="Anchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 319.">[319]</a> and it was not until October that Thomas again
saw him at Tours, on his way to a conference with Count
Theobald of Blois at Amboise.<a id="Anchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 320.">[320]</a> A difficulty had arisen
about the restitution of the confiscated Church property and
the absolution of the persons whom Thomas had excommunicated,
each party insisting that the other should make
the first step in conciliation.<a id="Anchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 321.">[321]</a> There was also a difficulty
about the kiss of peace, which Thomas required as pledge of
Henry’s sincerity, but which Henry seemed desirous of postponing
indefinitely.<a id="Anchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 322.">[322]</a> Nevertheless, a letter from Henry to
his son, announcing the reconciliation and bidding the
young king enforce the restoration of the archiepiscopal
estates, was drawn up in Thomas’s presence at Amboise and
sent over to England by the hands of two of his clerks,<a id="Anchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 323.">[323]</a>
who presented it at Westminster on October 5.<a id="Anchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 324.">[324]</a> The
restoration was, however, not effected until Martinmas, and
then it comprised little more than empty garners and ruined
houses.<a id="Anchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 325.">[325]</a> Thomas saw the king once more, at Chaumont,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">ii.75</a></span><a id="Anchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 326.">[326]</a>
and Henry promised to meet him again at Rouen, thence to
proceed with him to England in person.<a id="Anchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 327.">[327]</a> Before the appointed
time came, however, fresh complications had arisen
with the king of France; Henry was obliged to give up all
thought of going not only to England but even to Normandy,
and delegated the archbishop of Rouen and the dean of
Salisbury to escort Thomas in his stead.</p>

<p>The duty finally devolved solely upon the dean, who
was no other than Thomas’s old opponent John of Oxford.<a id="Anchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 328.">[328]</a>
Naturally enough, the primate was deeply hurt at being thus
sent back to his see under the protection of a man who, as
he truly said, ought to have been thankful for the privilege
of travelling in his suite.<a id="Anchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 329.">[329]</a> Thomas, however, was in haste
to be gone, although fully persuaded that he was going to
his death. He seems indeed to have been weary of life;
the tone of his letters and of his parting words to the friends
whom he was leaving in France indicates not so much a
morbid presentiment of his fate as a passionate longing for it.
Yet it can hardly have been from him alone that the foreboding
communicated itself to so many other minds.
Warnings came to him from all quarters; one voice after
another, from the king of France<a id="Anchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 330.">[330]</a> down to the very pilot of
the ship in which he took his passage, implored him not to
go; Herbert of Bosham alone upheld his resolution to the
end.<a id="Anchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 331.">[331]</a></p>

<p>We may put aside at once all the wild talk of the archbishop’s
biographers about plots against his life in which the
king had a share. Even if Henry’s sudden willingness for
his return was really suggested by words said to have been
uttered by one of his counsellors—“Why keep the archbishop
out of England? It would be far better to keep
him in it”—there is no need to assume that those words
bore even in the speaker’s mind, far less in that of the king,
the horrible meaning which they were afterwards supposed
to have covered;<a id="Anchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 332.">[332]</a> for they were true in the most literal sense.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">ii.76</a></span>
The quarrel of king and primate would have mattered little
had it been fought out on English ground; it was the archbishop’s
exile which rendered him so dangerous. Thomas
had dealt his most fatal blow at Henry by flying from him,
and Henry, as he now perceived, had made his worst blunder
in driving Thomas into France. Of the infinitely greater
blunder involved in the archbishop’s murder—setting the
criminal aspect of the deed altogether aside—it is enough to
say that Henry was wholly incapable. The same may be
said of Roger of York and Gilbert of London, although, like
the king himself, they were urged by dread of the archbishop
into making common cause with men of a very different
stamp<span class="nobreak">:—</span>men who hated the primate with a far more intense
personal hatred, and who were restrained by no considerations
either of policy or of morality<span class="nobreak">:—</span>men such as Ralf de
Broc, a ruffian adventurer who had served as the tool of
Henry’s vengeance upon the archbishop’s kinsfolk, had
resumed the custody of the archiepiscopal estates when it was
resigned by Gilbert Foliot, had been for the last four years
at once fattening upon the property of Thomas and smarting
under his excommunication, and was ready to commit any
crime rather than disgorge his ill-gotten gains.<a id="Anchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 333.">[333]</a> It was
known that Thomas had letters from the Pope suspending
all those bishops who had taken part in the coronation of
the young king, and replacing Gilbert of London, Jocelyn of
Salisbury, and all whom Thomas had excommunicated under
the sentences from which they had been irregularly released
by some of the Papal envoys.<a id="Anchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 334.">[334]</a> Gilbert, Jocelyn and Roger
of York now hurried to Canterbury, intending to proceed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">ii.77</a></span>
Normandy as soon as Thomas set foot in England; while
Ralf de Broc, Reginald de Warren and Gervase of Cornhill
the sheriff of Kent undertook to catch him at the moment
of landing, ransack his baggage, search his person, and seize
any Papal letters which he might bring with him. Thomas,
however was warned; he sent the letters over before him,
and the three prelates at Canterbury read their condemnation
before their judge quitted Gaul.<a id="Anchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 335.">[335]</a> Next day he sailed from
Wissant, and on the morning of December 1 he landed at
Sandwich.<a id="Anchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 336.">[336]</a> His enemies were ready to receive him; but
at the sight of John of Oxford they stopped short, and John
in the king’s name forbade all interference with the primate.<a id="Anchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 337.">[337]</a>
Amid the rapturous greetings of the people who thronged to
welcome their chief pastor, he rode on to Canterbury; there
some of the royal officials came to him in the king’s name,
demanding the absolution of the suspended and excommunicate
bishops. Thomas at first answered that he could
not annul a Papal sentence; but he afterwards offered to
take the risk of doing so, if the culprits would abjure their
errors in the form prescribed by the Church. Gilbert and
Jocelyn were inclined to yield; but Roger refused, and
they ended by despatching Geoffrey Ridel to enlist the
sympathies of the young king in their behalf, while they
themselves carried their protest to his father in Normandy.<a id="Anchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 338.">[338]</a></p>

In the last place Thomas says
that Ralf “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in ecclesiam Dei <span class="dots">...</span> per septem annos licentius debacchatus est</span>”;
and the writer of the
    <cite><i>Thomas Saga</i> (Magnusson), <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 321</cite>,
seems to have
understood this as meaning that Ralf had had the stewardship of the Canterbury
property throughout the archbishop’s exile. This, however, does not appear to
have been the case. Ralf certainly had the stewardship for a short time at first;
but it was, as we have seen, soon transferred to Gilbert Foliot, and only restored
to Ralf when Gilbert resigned it early in 1167.

<p>The young king was preparing to hold his Christmas
court at Winchester.<a id="Anchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 339.">[339]</a> Thomas proposed to join it, but was
stopped in London by a peremptory command to “go back
and mind his own business at Canterbury.”<a id="Anchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 340.">[340]</a> He obeyed
under protest, and on Christmas-day again excommunicated
the De Brocs and their fellow-robbers.<a id="Anchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 341.">[341]</a> The elder king was
keeping the feast at his hunting-seat of Bures near Bayeux.<a id="Anchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 342.">[342]</a>
There the three bishops threw themselves at his feet; Roger
of York spoke in the name of all, and presented the Papal
letters;<a id="Anchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 343.">[343]</a> the courtiers burst into a confused storm of indignation,
but not one had any counsel to offer. In his impatience
and disappointment Henry uttered the fatal words which he
was to rue all his life: “What a parcel of fools and dastards
have I nourished in my house, that none of them can be
found to avenge me of this one upstart clerk!”<a id="Anchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 344.">[344]</a></p>

<p>The words were hardly more than he had used at Chinon
four years before, but they fell now upon other ears. Four
knights—Hugh de Morville, William de Tracy, Reginald
Fitz-Urse and Richard le Breton<a id="Anchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 345.">[345]</a>—took them as a warrant
for the primate’s death. That night—it was Christmas-eve<a id="Anchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 346.">[346]</a>—they
vowed to slay him, no matter how or where;<a id="Anchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 347.">[347]</a> they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">ii.79</a></span>
left the court in secret, crossed to England by different routes,<a id="Anchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 348.">[348]</a>
and met again at Saltwood, a castle which the archbishop
had been vainly endeavouring to recover from the clutches
of Ralf de Broc, and where Ralf himself was dwelling amid a
crowd of his kinsfolk and dependents. There the final plot
was laid.<a id="Anchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 349.">[349]</a> How it was executed is a tale which has been
told so often that its details may well be spared here. On
the evening of December 29, after a scene in his own hall
scarcely less disgraceful than the last scene in the king’s hall
at Northampton, the primate of all England was butchered
at the altar’s foot in his own cathedral church.<a id="Anchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 350.">[350]</a></p>

<p>The ill news travelled fast. It fell like a thunderbolt
upon the Norman court still gathered round the king at
Argentan,<a id="Anchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 351.">[351]</a> whither the assembly had adjourned after the
Christmas feast at Bures. Henry stood for a moment
speechless with horror, then burst into a frenzy of despair,
and shut himself up in his own rooms, refusing to eat or
drink or to see any one.<a id="Anchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 352.">[352]</a> In a few days more, as he anticipated,
all Christendom was ringing with execration of the
murder and clamouring for vengeance upon the king who
was universally regarded as its instigator. The Pope ordered
an interdict upon Henry’s continental dominions, excommunicated
the murderers and all who had given or should
henceforth give them aid, shelter or support, and was only
restrained from pronouncing a like sentence upon the king
himself by a promise that he would make compurgation and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">ii.80</a></span>
submit to penance.<a id="Anchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 353.">[353]</a> Two cardinal-legates charged with the
enforcement of these decrees were at once despatched to
Normandy;<a id="Anchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 354.">[354]</a> but when they arrived there, Henry was out of
their reach. The death of Duke Conan in February had
thrown Britanny completely into his hands; he only stayed
to secure Geoffrey’s final establishment there as duke<a id="Anchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 355.">[355]</a> before
he called a council at Argentan and announced that he was
going to Ireland.<a id="Anchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 356.">[356]</a> He quitted Normandy just as the legates

Ireland from any part of his dominions.<a id="Anchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 363.">[363]</a> The bishops and
the ministers were left to fight their own battles and make
their own peace with the legates in Normandy until May
1172, when the king suddenly reappeared<a id="Anchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 364.">[364]</a> to claim the
papal absolution and offer in return not only his own spiritual
obedience and that of his English and continental
realms, but also that of Ireland, which he had secured for
Rome as her share in the spoils of a conquest won with
Adrian’s bull in his hand.<a id="Anchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 365.">[365]</a> The bargain was soon struck.
On Sunday May 21 Henry met the legates at Avranches,
made his purgation for the primate’s death, promised the
required expiation, and abjured his obnoxious “customs,”
his eldest son joining in the abjuration.<a id="Anchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 366.">[366]</a> To pacify Louis,

These three are the only writers who mention
this purgation in September, and they say nothing of the one in May. That it
took place is however clear from the letter of the legates themselves
    <cite>(<abbr title="Epistle 774">Ep. dcclxxiv.</abbr> Robertson, <i>Becket</i>, <abbr title="volume 7">vol. vii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 521)</cite>,
giving its date, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vocem jucunditatis</i>,” <i>i.e.</i>
Rogation-Sunday. On the other hand, the <abbr title="Lansdowne Manuscripts">MS. Lansdown.</abbr> (<i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="volume 4">vol. iv.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr>
173, 174) mentions only one purgation, and this clearly is the earlier one, for
it is placed before the re-crowning of young Henry. The explanation seems to be
that this was a private ceremony between the king and the legates, with a few
chosen witnesses; the legates say in their letter that Henry promised to repeat it
publicly at Caen; he probably did so at Avranches instead. On the other hand,
<abbr title="Robert of Torigni">Rob. Torigni</abbr> (<abbr title="year">a.</abbr> 1172) says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Locutus est cum eis primo Savigneii, postea Abrincis,

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is in the history of the settlements formed on the Irish
coast by the northern pirates in the ninth century that we
must seek for the origin of those relations between England
and Ireland which led to an English invasion of the latter
country in the reign of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> The earliest intercourse
between the two islands had been of a wholly peaceful
character; but it had come utterly to an end when Bishop
Colman of Lindisfarne sailed back to his old home at Iona
after the synod of Whitby in 664. From the hour when
her missionary work was done, Ireland sank more and more
into the isolation which was a natural consequence of her
geographical position, and from which she was only roused
at the opening of the ninth century by the coming of the
wikings. In the early days of the northmen’s attack upon
the British isles it was the tradition of Ireland’s material
prosperity and wealth, and the fame of the treasures stored
in her religious houses, that chiefly tempted the “white
strangers” from the Norwegian fiords across the unknown
perils of the western sea; and the settlement of Thorgils in
Ulster and those of his fellow-wikings along the eastern and
southern coasts of Ireland formed a chief basis for the operations
of the northmen upon Britain itself. The desperate
fighting of the Irish succeeded in freeing Ulster after Thorgils’s
death; but by the middle of the ninth century the
wikings were firmly established at four points on the Irish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">ii.83</a></span>
coast, Dublin, Waterford, Cork and Limerick.<a id="Anchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 369.">[369]</a> Under the
leadership of Olaf the Fair, Dublin became the head of a
confederacy which served as a starting-point and furnished
a constant supply of forces for the Danish conquests in England;<a id="Anchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 370.">[370]</a>
and for a hundred years afterwards, throughout the
struggle of the house of Ælfred for the recovery of the Danelaw,
the support given by the Ostmen or wikings of Ireland
to their brethren across the channel was at once the main
strength of the Northumbrian Danes and the standing difficulty
of the English kings.<a id="Anchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 371.">[371]</a></p>

<p>To Ireland itself the results of the wiking invasions were
far more disastrous than either to Britain or to Gaul. Owing
to the peculiar physical character of their country, to their
geographical remoteness from the rest of Europe, and to the
political and social isolation which was a consequence of
these, the Irish people had never advanced beyond the
primitive tribal mode of life which had once been common
to the whole Aryan race, but which every European branch
of that race, except the Irish, had long since outgrown. In
the time of Ecgberht and of Charles the Great Ireland was
still, as at the very dawn of history, peopled by a number of
separate tribes or septs whose sole bond of internal cohesion
was formed by community of blood;—whose social and
political institutions had remained purely patriarchal in
character, unaffected by local and external influences such
as had helped to mould the life of England or of Gaul<span class="nobreak">:—</span>who
had never yet coalesced into any definite territorial
organization, far less risen into national unity under a
national sovereign. The provincial kings of Ulster, Connaught,
Leinster and Munster were merely the foremost
chieftains among the various groups of tribes over whom
they exercised an ever-shifting sway; while the supremacy
of the <i lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Ard-Righ</i> or chief monarch, to whom in theory was
assigned the overlordship of the whole island, was practically
little more than a sort of honorary pre-eminence attached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">ii.84</a></span>
to certain chosen descendants of an early hero-king, Niall
“of the Nine Hostages”; it carried with it little effective
authority, and no territorial power; for the monarch’s traditional
seat at Tara had long been a heap of ruins, and a
tribal under-king had ousted him from the plain of Meath
which in legal theory formed his royal domain.<a id="Anchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 372.">[372]</a> Neither in
the monarch himself nor in the provincial chieftains of a
state thus constituted could there be found, when the storm-cloud
from the north burst upon Ireland, a centre of unity
even such as the peoples of Gaul found in their Karolingian
sovereigns, far less such as the West-Franks found in the
dukes of the French, or such as the English found in their
kings of the house of Ecgberht. The stress of the northmen’s
attack, which elsewhere gave a fresh impulse to the
upgrowth of national life, crushed out all hope of its developement
in Ireland. The learning and the civilization of ages
perished when Columba’s Bangor, Bridget’s Kildare, Ciaran’s
Clonmacnoise, Patrick’s own Armagh, shared the fate of
Bæda’s Jarrow and Hild’s Streoneshealh, of Cuthbert’s
Melrose and Aidan’s Lindisfarne; and in Ireland there was
no Wessex and no Ælfred.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the concentration of the wiking
forces upon Britain had given to the Irish an advantage
which enabled them to check the spread of wiking settlements
in their country; and the failure of all attempts to
establish a Scandinavian dominion in Britain destroyed all
chance of a Scandinavian conquest of Ireland. The Ostmen
never even gained such a footing in Ireland as the followers
of Hrolf gained in Frankland: their presence never received
the sanction of any Ard-Righ; they were not a compact
body occupying the whole of an extensive and well-defined
territory, but a number of separate groups settled here and
there along the coast, and holding their ground only by
sheer hard fighting against a ring of implacable foes. The
long struggle may be said to have ended in a defeat of both
parties. The Irish kings of Munster succeeded in establishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">ii.85</a></span>
a more or less effective overlordship over the Scandinavian
communities of Limerick and Waterford; and in
989 Malachi <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, supreme monarch of Ireland, reaped his
reward for nine years of desperate fighting in the submission
of the Ostmen of Dublin. The city was blockaded and
starved into surrender, and a yearly tribute was promised
to Malachi and his successors.<a id="Anchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 373.">[373]</a> Six years later “the ring
of Tomar and the sword of Carl”—two heathen relics probably
of ancient heroes, which seem to have been treasured
as sacred emblems of sovereignty by the Ostmen<a id="Anchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 374.">[374]</a>—were
carried off by Malachi as trophies of another victory;<a id="Anchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 375.">[375]</a> and
in 999 or 1000 a renewal of the strife ended in a rout of
the Ostmen and a great slaughter of their leaders, and
Dublin was sacked and burnt by the victorious Irish.<a id="Anchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 376.">[376]</a></p>

<p>Malachi’s triumph, however, was gained at the cost of a
disruption of the monarchy. Malachi himself was displaced
by a king of the rival house of Munster, his colleague in the
sack of Dublin, the famous Brian Boroimhe;<a id="Anchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 377.">[377]</a> Brian’s career
of conquest ended in 1014 on the field of Clontarf, where
he was slain in battle with the men of Leinster and the
Ostmen;<a id="Anchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 378.">[378]</a> and when Malachi, who now resumed his place,
died in 1022,<a id="Anchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 379.">[379]</a> the downfall of the Irish monarchy was complete.<a id="Anchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 380.">[380]</a>
The tradition which had so long linked it to the
house of Niall had been shattered by Brian’s successes; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">ii.86</a></span>
Brian had not lived to consolidate in his own house the forces
which had begun to gather around himself. Thenceforth
the Scandinavian colonies simply furnished an additional
element to the strife of the Irish chieftains, and to the rivalry
between the O’Briens of Munster and the O’Neills of Ulster
for the possession of a shadowy supremacy, claimed by the one
house as descendants of Brian Boroimhe and by the other
as heirs of Malachi <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> and of his great ancestor Niall.</p>

“From the death of Maelseachlainn <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> the legitimate monarchy of all Ireland
departed from all families during seventy-two years, until the joint reigns of Muircheartach
O’Briain and Domhnall MacLochlainn; during that time no <span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Feis</span> or

supreme king.” Quoted by
    <cite>Mr. Kelly, note to <i>Cambrensis Eversus</i>, <abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 38,
from Gilla-Modud, an Irish poet of the twelfth century</cite>.

<p>The social and political system of Ireland was powerless
either to expel or to absorb the foreign element thus introduced
within its borders. Not only was such an union of
the two peoples as had at last been effected in England
simply impossible in Ireland; the Irish Danelaw was parted
from its Celtic surroundings by barriers of race and speech,
of law and custom and institutions, far more insuperable
than those which parted the settlers in the “northman’s land”
at the mouth of Seine from their West-Frankish neighbours.
Even the Irish Church, which three hundred years before had
won half England—one might add half Europe—to the
Faith, had as yet failed to convert these pagans seated at her
door. At the close of the tenth century the Ostmen were
still for the most part heathens in fact if not in name, aliens
from whatever culture or civilization might still remain in
the nation around them. Meanwhile their relations with
England had wholly altered in character. The final submission
of the English Danelaw to Eadred carried with it
the alliance of the Irish Danelaw; it seems that the Ostmen
in their turn endeavoured to strengthen themselves against
the attacks of the Irish princes by securing a good understanding
with the English king, if not actually by putting
themselves under his protection; for the fact that Eadgar
coined money in Dublin<a id="Anchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 381.">[381]</a> indicates that his authority must
have been in some way or other acknowledged there. The
years of the Ostmen’s struggle with Malachi and Brian
Boroimhe were the years of England’s struggle with Swein
and Cnut; but the two strifes seem to have been wholly
unconnected; and throughout the long peace which lasted
from Cnut’s final triumph until the coming of the Normans,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">ii.87</a></span>
new ties sprang up between the Ostmen and the sister-isle.
Owing to their position on the sea-coast and to the spirit of
merchant enterprise which was, quite as much as the spirit of
military enterprise, a part of the wiking-heritage of their
inhabitants, the towns of the Irish Danelaw rose fast into
importance as seats of a flourishing trade with northern
Europe, and above all with England through its chief seaports
in the west, Bristol and Chester. The traffic was
chiefly in slaves, bought or kidnapped in England to be sold
to the merchants of Dublin or Waterford, and by these again
to their Irish neighbours or to traders from yet more distant
lands.<a id="Anchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 382.">[382]</a> Horrible as this traffic was, however, even while
filling the Irish coast-towns with English slaves it helped to
foster a more frequent intercourse and a closer relation
between Ostmen and Englishmen; and the shelter and aid
given to Harold and Leofwine in 1151 by Dermot Mac-Maelnambo,<a id="Anchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 383.">[383]</a>
a prince of the royal house of Leinster who had
acquired the sovereignty over both Leinstermen and Danes,
shews that the political alliance established in Eadgar’s day
had been carefully renewed by Godwine.</p>

<p>To these commercial and political relations was added
soon afterwards an ecclesiastical tie. The conversion of the
Ostmen to Christianity, completed in the early years of the
eleventh century, was probably due to intercourse with their
Christianized brethren in England rather than to the influence
of the Irish clergy, whose very speech was strange to
them; and their adoption of their neighbours’ creed, instead
of drawing together the hostile races, soon introduced a fresh
element into their strife. About the year 1040 the Ostmen
of Dublin set up a bishopric of their own. Their first
bishop, Donatus, was probably Irish by consecration if not
by birth.<a id="Anchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 384.">[384]</a> But when he died, in 1074,<a id="Anchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 385.">[385]</a> the Ostmen turned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">ii.88</a></span>
instinctively towards the neighbouring island with which
they had long been on peaceful terms, where the fruits of
the warfare waged by generation after generation of wikings
upon the shores of Britain were being reaped at last by
Norman hands, where William of Normandy was entering
upon the inheritance alike of Ælfred and of Cnut, and where
Lanfranc was infusing a new spirit of discipline and activity
into the Church of Odo and Dunstan. The last wiking-fleet
that ever sailed from Dublin to attack the English coast—a
fleet which Dermot Mac-Maelnambo, true to his alliance with
their father, had furnished to the sons of Harold—had been
beaten back six years before.<a id="Anchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 386.">[386]</a> Since then Dermot himself
was dead;<a id="Anchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 387.">[387]</a> the Ostmen were once more free, subject to no
ruler save one of their own choice and their own blood;
with the consent of their king, Godred,<a id="Anchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 388.">[388]</a> they chose a priest
named Patrick to fill Donatus’s place, and sent him to be
consecrated in England by the archbishop of Canterbury.<a id="Anchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 389.">[389]</a>
No scruples about infringing the rights of the Irish bishops
were likely to make Lanfranc withhold his hand. At the
very moment when the Ostmen’s request reached him, he
had just been putting forth against the archbishop of York
a claim to metropolitical jurisdiction over the whole of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">ii.89</a></span>
British isles, founded on the words of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Gregory committing
“all the bishops of the Britains” to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Augustine’s charge.<a id="Anchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 390.">[390]</a>
He therefore gladly welcomed an opportunity of securing for
the authority of his see a footing in the neighbour-isle. He
consecrated Patrick of Dublin and received his profession of
obedience;<a id="Anchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 391.">[391]</a> and for the next seventy-eight years the bishops
of Dublin were suffragans not of Armagh but of Canterbury.
When in 1096 the Ostmen of Waterford also chose for
themselves a bishop, they too sought him beyond the sea;
an Irishman, or more probably an Ostman by birth, a monk
of Winchester by profession, Malchus by name, he was consecrated
by <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Anselm and professed obedience to him as
metropolitan.<a id="Anchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 392.">[392]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<ul>
  <li>
    <a id="Footnote_384" href="#Anchor_384" title="Return to text.">[384]</a>
That is, he was certainly not consecrated in England;

 But might he not have been consecrated by some
of the bishops in Scotland and the Isles, with which the Ostmen were in constant
intercourse and alliance?

under the
overlordship of Dermot. On Dermot’s death the Ostmen flung off the Irish supremacy and took for their king, first a jarl named Godred, who died in 1072,

<p>Through the medium of these Irish suffragans the archbishops
of Canterbury endeavoured to gain a hold upon the
Irish Church by cultivating the friendship of the different
Irish princes who from time to time succeeded in winning
from the Ostmen an acknowledgement of their overlordship.
In the struggles of the provincial kings for the supreme
monarchy of Ireland it was always the Ostmen who turned
the scale; their submission was the real test of sovereignty.
The power which had been wielded by Dermot Mac-Maelnambo
passed after his death first to Terence or Turlogh
O’Brien, king of Munster,<a id="Anchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 393.">[393]</a> a grandson of Brian Boroimhe,
and then to Terence’s son Murtogh.<a id="Anchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 394.">[394]</a> Both were in correspondence
with the successive English primates, Lanfranc
and Anselm,<a id="Anchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 395.">[395]</a> and both were recognized as protectors and
patrons, in ecclesiastical matters at least, by the Ostmen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">ii.90</a></span><a id="Anchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 396.">[396]</a>
whose adherence during these years enabled the O’Briens to
hold their ground against the advancing power of Donnell
O’Lochlainn, king of Aileach or western Ulster,<a id="Anchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 397.">[397]</a> a representative
of the old royal house of the O’Neills which had
fallen with Malachi <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> On Murtogh’s death in 1119<a id="Anchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 398.">[398]</a> a new
aspirant to the monarchy appeared in the person of the
young king of Connaught, Terence or Turlogh O’Conor. A
year before, Terence had won the submission of the Ostmen
of Dublin;<a id="Anchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 399.">[399]</a> in 1120 he celebrated the fair of Telltown,<a id="Anchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 400.">[400]</a> a
special prerogative of the Irish monarchs; and from the
death of Donnell O’Lochlainn next year<a id="Anchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 401.">[401]</a> Terence was undisputed
monarch till 1127, when a joint rising of Ostmen
and Leinstermen enabled both to throw off his yoke.<a id="Anchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 402.">[402]</a>
Meanwhile Murtogh O’Lochlainn, a grandson of Donnell,
was again building up a formidable power in Ulster; at
last, in 1150, all the provincial kings, including Terence,
gave him hostages for peace;<a id="Anchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 403.">[403]</a> and Terence’s throne seems
to have been only saved by a sudden change in the policy
of the Ostmen, whose independent action enabled them for a
moment to hold the balance and act as arbitrators between
northern and southern Ireland.<a id="Anchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 404.">[404]</a> Four years later, however,
they accepted Murtogh as their king,<a id="Anchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 405.">[405]</a> and two years later<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">ii.91</a></span>
still he was left sole monarch by the death of Terence
O’Conor.<a id="Anchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 406.">[406]</a></p>

<p>The anarchy of the Irish state was reflected in that of
the Church. If Lanfranc, when he consecrated Patrick of
Dublin, knew anything at all of the ecclesiastical condition
of Ireland, he may well have thought that it stood in far
greater need of his reforming care than England itself. The
Irish Church had never felt the organizing hand of a
Theodore; its diocesan and parochial system was quite undeveloped;
it had in fact scarcely advanced beyond the
primitive missionary stage. Six centuries after <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Patrick’s
death, the Irish clergy were still nothing but a band of
mission-priests scattered over the country or gathered together
in vast monastic establishments like Bangor or Durrow
or Clonmacnoise; the bishops were for the most part
merely heads of ever-shifting mission-stations, to whose
number there was no limit; destitute of political rank, they
were almost equally destitute of ecclesiastical authority, and
differed from the ordinary priesthood by little else than their
power of ordination. At the head of the whole hierarchy
stood, as successor and representative of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Patrick, the archbishop
of Armagh. But since the death of Archbishop
Maelbrigid in 927 the see of Armagh had been in the hands
of a family of local chieftains who occupied its estate,
usurped its revenues, handed on its title from father to son,
and were bishops only in name.<a id="Anchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 407.">[407]</a> The inferior members of
the ecclesiastical body could not escape the evil which paralyzed
their head. The bishops and priests of the Irish
Church furnished a long roll of names to the catalogue of
saints; but they contributed little or nothing to the political
developement of the nation, and scarcely more to its social
developement. The growth of a class of lay-impropriators
ousted them from the management and the revenues of their
church-lands, reduced them to subsist almost wholly upon
the fees which they received for the performance of their
spiritual functions, stripped them of all political influence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">ii.92</a></span>
and left them dependent solely upon their spiritual powers
and their personal holiness for whatever share of social influence
they might still contrive to retain.<a id="Anchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 408.">[408]</a> The Irish
Church, in fact, while stedfastly adhering in doctrinal
matters to the rest of the Latin Church, had fallen far
behind it in discipline; to the monastic reforms of the
tenth century, to the struggle for clerical celibacy and for
freedom of investiture in the eleventh, she had remained
an utter stranger. The long-continued stress of the
northern invasions had cut off the lonely island in the
west from all intercourse with the world at large, so
completely that even the tie which bound her to Rome
had sunk into a mere vague tradition of spiritual loyalty,
and Rome herself knew nothing of the actual condition
of a Church which had once been her most illustrious
daughter.</p>

<p>But it was the northmen, too, who were now to become
the means of knitting up again the ties which had been
severed by their fathers’ swords. The state of things in
Ireland, as reported to Canterbury from Dublin and Waterford,
might well seem to reforming churchmen like Lanfranc
and Anselm too grievous to be endured. Lanfranc had
urged upon Terence O’Brien the removal of two of its worst
scandals, the neglect of canonical restraints upon marriage
and the existence of a crowd of titular bishops without fixed
sees;<a id="Anchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 409.">[409]</a> Anselm used all his influence with Murtogh O’Brien
for the same end;<a id="Anchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 410.">[410]</a> at last, finding his efforts unavailing, he
seems to have laid his complaints before the Pope. The
result was that, for the first time, a papal legate was appointed
for Ireland. The person chosen was Gilbert, who
some two or three years before Anselm’s death became the
first bishop of the Ostmen of Limerick. Gilbert seems, like
the first Donatus of Dublin, to have been himself an Irish
prelate; he lost no time, however, in putting himself in communication<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">ii.93</a></span>
with Canterbury,<a id="Anchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 411.">[411]</a> and displayed an almost
exaggerated zeal for the Roman discipline and ritual.<a id="Anchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 412.">[412]</a> In
1118 he presided over a synod held at Rathbreasil, where
an attempt was made to map out the dioceses of Ireland on
a definite plan.<a id="Anchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 413.">[413]</a> Little, however, could be done till the
metropolitan see was delivered from the usurpers who
had so long held it in bondage; and it was not until
1134 that the evil tradition was broken by the election of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Malachi.</p>

<p>Malachi was the wisest and most enlightened as well as
the most saintly Irish prelate of his time; he had already
been labouring for nearly ten years at the reform of the
diocese of Connor; in that of Armagh itself he had earlier
still, as vicar to Archbishop Celsus, laid the foundations of a
similar work which he now took up again as primate.<a id="Anchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 414.">[414]</a> After
a successful pontificate of three years he again retired to the
humbler position of a diocesan bishop at Down;<a id="Anchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 415.">[415]</a> but he
still continued to watch over the interests of the whole Irish
Church; and in 1139 he went to Rome specially to lay its
necessities before the Pope, and if possible to obtain from
him the gift of a pallium for the archbishop of Armagh, and
another for the bishop of Cashel as metropolitan of southern
Ireland.<a id="Anchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 416.">[416]</a> The pallium was now generally regarded as an
indispensable note of metropolitical rank, but it had never
been possessed by the successors of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Patrick.<a id="Anchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 417.">[417]</a> Innocent
<abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> refused to grant it save at the request of the Irish
clergy and people in council assembled; he sanctioned, however,
the recognition of Cashel as metropolis of southern
Ireland, and moreover he transferred to Malachi himself the
legatine commission which Gilbert of Limerick had just
resigned.<a id="Anchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 418.">[418]</a> Gilbert seems to have died shortly afterwards:
his successor in the see of Limerick went to Theobald of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">ii.94</a></span>
Canterbury for consecration; but his profession of obedience
was the last ever made by an Irish bishop to an English
metropolitan.<a id="Anchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 419.">[419]</a> In 1148 a synod held at Inispatrick by
Archbishop Gelasius of Armagh, with Malachi as papal
legate, decided upon sending Malachi himself to the Pope
once more, charged with a formal request for the two
palls, in the name of the whole Irish Church. Malachi
died on the way, at Clairvaux;<a id="Anchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 420.">[420]</a> but he left his commission
in safe hands. Nine years before, when on his first journey
to Rome he had passed through the “bright valley,” its
abbot had recognized in him a kindred spirit.<a id="Anchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 421.">[421]</a> From that
moment <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard’s care of all the churches extended itself
even to the far-off Church of Ireland; and if it was not he
who actually forwarded his dying friend’s petition to Eugene
<abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>, there can be little doubt that Eugene’s favourable
reception of it was chiefly owing to his influence. The
result was the mission of John Paparo as special legate to
Ireland. Stephen’s refusal to let John pass through his
dominions caused another year’s delay;<a id="Anchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 422.">[422]</a> but at the close of
1151 John made his way through Scotland safe to his destination.<a id="Anchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 423.">[423]</a>
In March 1152 he held a synod at Kells, in which
the diocesan and provincial system of the Irish Church was
organized upon lines which remained unaltered till the
sixteenth century. The episcopal sees were definitely fixed,
and grouped under not two but four archbishoprics. The
primacy of all Ireland, with metropolitical authority over
Ulster and Meath, was assigned to Armagh; Tuam became
the metropolis of Connaught, Cashel of Munster; while the
rivalry of Armagh and Canterbury for the spiritual obedience
of the Ostmen was settled by the grant of a fourth pallium,
with metropolitical jurisdiction over the whole of Leinster,
to Bishop Gregory of Dublin himself.<a id="Anchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 424.">[424]</a></p>

<p>It is plain that Bernard and Eugene aimed at applying
to Ireland’s troubles the same remedy which they were at
that very time applying to those of England. They hoped
to build up an united nation and a strong national government
on the basis of a free and united national Church.
But the foundation-stone of their work for Ireland was
scarcely laid at Kells when both the wise master-builders
were called away. On the other hand, their labours for
England were crowned by the accession of the young
Angevin king, whose restless temper, before he had been
nine months on his throne, was already seeking for another
sphere of activity still further beyond the sea; overwhelming
the newly-crowned, English-born Pope with suggestions of
work and offers of co-operation in every quarter of Christendom,<a id="Anchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 425.">[425]</a>
and proposing to begin at once with the reduction
of Ireland to political, ecclesiastical and social order after
the pattern of England and Normandy.<a id="Anchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 426.">[426]</a> Adrian <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr> would
have needed a wisdom and a foresight greater than those of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard himself to enable him to resist the attractions of
such an offer. The so-called “Donation of Constantine”—a
donation which is now known to be forged, but whose
genuineness no one in Adrian’s day had ever thought of
doubting—vested the ultimate sovereignty of all islands in
the Papacy.<a id="Anchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 427.">[427]</a> The best and greatest Popes, from <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Gregory
down to Adrian himself, seem to have interpreted this as
making them in a special way responsible for the welfare of
such outlying portions of Christendom, and bound to leave
no means untried for providing them with a secure and
orderly Christian government.<a id="Anchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 428.">[428]</a> The action of Alexander <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">ii.96</a></span>
in sanctioning the Norman conquest of England was a
logical outcome of this principle, applied, however unwisely
or unjustly, to a particular case. But there was infinitely
greater justification for applying the same principle, in the
same manner, to the case of Ireland. Neither the labours
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Malachi, nor the brief visit of John Paparo, nor the
stringent decrees passed at the synod of Kells, could suffice
to reform the inveterate evils of Ireland’s ecclesiastical system,
the yet more inveterate evils of her political system, or the
intellectual and moral decay which was the unavoidable
consequence of both. On the Pope, according to the view
of the time, lay the responsibility of bringing order out of
this chaos—a chaos of whose very existence he had but just
become fully conscious, and which no doubt looked to him
far more hopeless than it really was. In such circumstances
Henry’s proposal must have sounded to Adrian like an offer
to relieve him of a great weight of care—to cut at one stroke
a knot which he was powerless to untie—to clear a path for
him through a jungle-growth of difficulties which he himself
saw no way to penetrate or overcome. John of Salisbury
set forth the plan at Rome, in Henry’s name, in the summer
of 1155; he carried back a bull which satisfied all Henry’s
demands. Adrian bade the king go forth to his conquest
“for the enlargement of the Church’s borders, for the restraint
of vice, the correction of morals and the planting of virtue,
the increase of the Christian religion, and whatsoever may
tend to God’s glory and the well-being of that land;”<a id="Anchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 429.">[429]</a> and
he sent with the bull a gold ring, adorned with an emerald
of great price, as a symbol of investiture with the government
of Ireland.<a id="Anchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 430.">[430]</a></p>

<p>This strange crusade was postponed for the moment,
as we have seen, in deference to objections made by the
Empress Matilda.<a id="Anchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 431.">[431]</a> Adrian’s bull and ring were stored up
in the English chancery, and there, long after Adrian was
dead, they still lay,<a id="Anchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 432.">[432]</a> unused and, as it seemed, forgotten
amid an ever-increasing throng of more urgent cares and
labours which even Henry found to be quite as much as he
was capable of sustaining. At last, however, the course of
political events in Ireland itself took a turn which led almost
irresistibly to a revival of his long-forsaken project. Two
years before Henry’s accession Dermot Mac-Murrough, king
of Leinster, had made a raid upon the district of Breffny in
Connaught, on the borders of Ulster and Meath, and carried
off Dervorgil, the wife of its chieftain Tighernan O’Ruark.<a id="Anchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 433.">[433]</a>
From that hour Tighernan’s vengeance never slept. During
the next fourteen years, while Murtogh O’Lochlainn was
striving for the mastery first against the veteran Terence
O’Conor and after Terence’s death with his son Rory or
Roderic, the swords of the men of Breffny were thrown alternately
into either scale, as their chieftain saw a hope of securing
the aid of either monarch to avenge him of his enemy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">ii.98</a></span><a id="Anchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 434.">[434]</a>
In 1166 the crisis came. Murtogh drew upon himself
the wrath of his people by blinding the king of Uladh,
for whose safety he was pledged to the archbishop of
Armagh; Ulster, Meath, Leinster and Dublin rose against
him all at once; he was defeated and slain in a great
battle at the Fews; the Ostmen of Dublin acknowledged
Roderic as their king, and all the princes of southern
Ireland followed their example. Dermot’s submission, however,
was in vain; the first act of the new monarch was to
banish him from the realm.<a id="Anchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 435.">[435]</a> The Leinstermen forsook him
at once, for their loyalty had long been alienated by his
harsh government and evil deeds.<a id="Anchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 436.">[436]</a> Left alone to the justice
of Roderic and the vengeance of O’Ruark, he fled to Cork
and thence took ship to Bristol. Here he found shelter for
a while in the priory of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Augustine, under the protection
of its founder Robert Fitz-Harding;<a id="Anchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 437.">[437]</a> at the close of the
year he made his way to Normandy, and thence, with some
difficulty, tracked Henry’s restless movements into the
depths of Aquitaine,<a id="Anchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 438.">[438]</a> where he at last laid his appeal for
succour at the feet of the English king.</p>

The two last-named authorities represent this
affair as the <em>immediate</em> cause of Dermot’s overthrow, and of all the consequent
troubles. Chronology shews this to be mere romance; yet, notwithstanding the
criticisms of some modern writers, there still seems to be some ground for the
earlier view which looked upon Dervorgil as a sort of Irish Helen. If we follow
carefully the thread of the story in the Four Masters from 1153 to 1166 we can
hardly avoid the conclusion that throughout those years the most important
personage in Irish politics, the man whose action turned the scale in nearly all the
ups and downs of fortune between Murtogh of Ulster and the kings of Connaught,
was the border-chieftain whose position made him the most dangerous of foes and
the most indispensable of allies—Tighernan O’Ruark; and we can hardly help
seeing in Dermot’s banishment the vengeance less of Roderic O’Conor himself
than of a supporter whom Roderic could not afford to leave unsatisfied. On the
other hand, it is perfectly true that the opportunity for executing that vengeance
was given by the disaffection of Dermot’s own subjects—and, as usual, more
especially by the rising of the Ostmen of Dublin.

<p>At the crisis of his struggles with Thomas of Canterbury,
with Louis of France and with the rebel barons of Poitou,
all that Henry could do was to accept Dermot’s offer of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">ii.99</a></span>
homage and fealty,<a id="Anchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 439.">[439]</a> promise to send him help as soon as
possible,<a id="Anchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 440.">[440]</a> and furnish him with a letter authorizing any loyal
English, Norman, Welsh, Scottish or Angevin subjects who
might be so disposed to join the standard of the Irish prince,
as of a faithful vassal of their sovereign.<a id="Anchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 441.">[441]</a> Another stay of
some weeks in Bristol<a id="Anchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 442.">[442]</a> convinced Dermot that his best
chance of aid lay beyond the Severn. Wales was still in
the main a Celtic land, ruled in primeval Celtic fashion by
native princes under little more than nominal subjection to
the king of England. The Norman conquest of Wales, so
far as Wales could be said to have been conquered at all,
had been effected not by the royal power but by the daring
and prowess of individual adventurers who did, indeed, seek
the royal sanction for their tenure of the lands which they
had won, but who were scarcely more amenable to the royal
authority than their Welsh neighbours, with whom they not
unfrequently made common cause against it. It was Robert
of Bellême’s connexion with Wales, through his border-earldom
of Shrewsbury and his brother’s lordship of Pembroke,
which had made him so formidable to Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>; it
was Robert of Gloucester’s tenure of the great Welsh lordship
of Glamorgan, even more than his English honours,
which had enabled him to act as an independent potentate
against Stephen. Another border-chieftain who played some
part in the civil war was Gilbert de Clare, whose father had
received a grant of Cardigan from Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> in 1107,<a id="Anchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 443.">[443]</a> and
upon whom Stephen in 1138 conferred the title of earl of
Pembroke.<a id="Anchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 444.">[444]</a> His son Richard appears under the same title
among the witnesses to Stephen’s proclamation of the treaty
of Wallingford in 1153;<a id="Anchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 445.">[445]</a> the writers of the time, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">ii.100</a></span>
usually describe him as earl of Striguil, a fortress which
seems to have occupied the site whence the ruins of Chepstow
castle now look down upon the Wye. His earldom of
Pembroke, indeed, as one of Stephen’s fictitious creations,
must have been forfeited on Henry’s accession; but the lord
of Striguil was still a mighty man on the South-Welsh border
when in the spring of 1167 he promised to bring all the
forces which he could muster to aid in restoring Dermot,
who in return offered him his daughter’s hand, together with
the succession to his kingdom.<a id="Anchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 446.">[446]</a> A promise of the town of
Wexford and its adjoining territory won a like assurance of
aid from two half-brothers in whose veins the blood of
Norman adventurers was mingled with the ancient royal
blood of South-Wales: Maurice Fitz-Gerald, a son of Gerald
constable of Pembroke by his marriage with Nest, aunt of
the reigning prince Rees Ap-Griffith, and Robert Fitz-Stephen,
son of the same Nest by her second husband,
Stephen constable of Cardigan.<a id="Anchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 447.">[447]</a> Another Pembrokeshire
knight, Richard Fitz-Godoberd, volunteered to accompany
Dermot at once with a little band of Norman-Welsh
followers.<a id="Anchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 448.">[448]</a> With these Dermot returned to Ireland in
August 1167;<a id="Anchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 449.">[449]</a> he was defeated in a pitched battle with
Roderic O’Conor and Tighernan O’Ruark;<a id="Anchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 450.">[450]</a> but in his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">ii.101</a></span>

throughout the winter he lay hid at Ferns,<a id="Anchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 452.">[452]</a> and thence,

claim from his Welsh allies the fulfilment of their promises.<a id="Anchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 453.">[453]</a></p>

The circumstances of Fitz-Stephen’s enlistment
illustrate the condition of South-Wales at this time. He had been cast into
prison three years before by his cousin Rees, and at the moment of Dermot’s
arrival had just been released on condition of joining Rees in an attack upon
England. His Norman blood, however, was loyal enough to revolt against the
fulfilment of the condition; and Rees, who had warmly espoused Dermot’s
interest, was persuaded to allow its exchange for service in Ireland.

<p>In the first days of May<a id="Anchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 454.">[454]</a> Robert Fitz-Stephen landed
at Bannow, between Wexford and Waterford, with thirty
picked knights of his own immediate following, and a body
of auxiliaries to the number of sixty men-at-arms and three
hundred archers.<a id="Anchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 455.">[455]</a> With him came three of his nephews,
Meiler Fitz-Henry, Miles Fitz-David<a id="Anchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 456.">[456]</a> and Robert de Barri;<a id="Anchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 457.">[457]</a>
and also a ruined knight called Hervey of Mountmorris,
uncle of Richard de Clare.<a id="Anchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 458.">[458]</a> Next day an independent adventurer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">ii.102</a></span>,
Maurice de Prendergast, arrived from Milford with
ten more knights and a band of archers.<a id="Anchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 459.">[459]</a> Dermot himself
came to meet them with some five hundred Irishmen. The
united force marched upon Wexford, and took it in two
days;<a id="Anchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 460.">[460]</a> they then established their head-quarters at Ferns,<a id="Anchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 461.">[461]</a>
and thence made an expedition into Ossory, whose chieftain
was specially hostile to Dermot. In spite of overwhelming
odds, through all the difficulties of an unknown country
full of woods and marshes, and traps laid against them by
their skilful foes, the Norman-Welsh knights and archers
made their way into the heart of Ossory; and a great
battle ended in the rout of the Irish and the bringing of
two hundred heads to Dermot’s feet in his camp on the
banks of the Barrow.<a id="Anchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 462.">[462]</a> A successful raid upon Offaly was
followed by one upon Glendalough, and a third upon
Ossory again,<a id="Anchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 463.">[463]</a> till in the following year the state of affairs
in Leinster had become threatening enough to drive all the
Irish princes and the Ostmen of Dublin into a confederacy
under Roderic O’Conor for the expulsion of the intruders.<a id="Anchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 464.">[464]</a>
Dermot pledged himself to acknowledge Roderic as monarch
of Ireland, and was in his turn acknowledged by Roderic
as king of Leinster on condition that he should dismiss his
foreign allies.<a id="Anchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 465.">[465]</a> The agreement was however scarcely made
when Maurice Fitz-Gerald landed at Wexford with some
hundred and forty men;<a id="Anchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 466.">[466]</a> these at once joined Dermot in
an expedition against Dublin, and harried the surrounding
country till the citizens were reduced to promise obedience.<a id="Anchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 467.">[467]</a>
Early in the next year Dermot’s son-in-law Donell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">ii.103</a></span>
O’Brien, king of Limerick or Northern Munster, succeeded
by the help of Robert Fitz-Stephen in throwing off the
authority of Roderick O’Conor.<a id="Anchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 468.">[468]</a> Encouraged by these
successes, Dermot now began to aspire in his turn to the
monarchy of all Ireland;<a id="Anchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 469.">[469]</a> but his auxiliaries were numerically
insufficient; and the one from whom he had expected
most had as yet failed to appear at all.</p>

All the later Irish
historians, as well as Lord Lyttelton and
    <cite>Mr. Dimock (<i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> margin)</cite>
date the
arrival of Fitz-Stephen in May 1169. The reason apparently is that, as far as
Dermot and his English auxiliaries are concerned, the year 1168 is a blank in the
    <cite>Four Masters</cite>,
while under 1169 they say: “The fleet of the Flemings came
from England in the army of Mac Murchadha, <i>i.e.</i> Diarmaid, to contest the
kingdom of Leinster for him; they were seventy heroes clad in coats of mail.”
But seeing that in the following year, 1170, they for the first time mention Robert
Fitz-Stephen, and represent him as coming over with Richard of Striguil
    (<cite>O’Donovan, <abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 1173–1175</cite>),
it is by no means evident that the foregoing
entry has any reference to him. It may just as well apply to Maurice Fitz-Gerald,
who certainly followed him after an interval of some months at least.
    <cite>Gerald (as above, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 2, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 229)</cite>
says that Fitz-Stephen and Fitz-Gerald both promised,
in the summer of 1167, to join Dermot “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum zephyris et hirundine primâ</span>.”
Maurice undoubtedly made a long delay; but there is not a word to shew that
Robert did otherwise than fulfil his engagement to the letter. Nay, Gerald
pointedly introduces him
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 3, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 230</cite>)
as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nec promissionis immemor nec
fidei contemptor</span>.” He also tells us
    (<cite><abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 2, <i>ibid.</i></cite>)
that Dermot had <em>wintered</em> at
Ferns. Why then are we to assume that by “wintered” he means “wintered,
summered, and wintered again”? What could Dermot possibly have been doing
there for more than twenty months?

<p>The history of Richard of Striguil is far from clear.
From the number of troops which eventually accompanied
him to Ireland it is evident that he had been during these
two years actively preparing for his expedition; and it may
even be that the extent of his preparations had drawn upon
him the suspicions of King Henry. We only know that,
for some cause or other, he was now a ruined man; his
lands were forfeited to the Crown;<a id="Anchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 470.">[470]</a> and he seems to have
lingered on, absorbed in a desperate effort to regain Henry’s
favour, and clinging to his lost home with a feeling that if
he once turned his back upon it, he would never be allowed
to see it again. A letter from Dermot, telling of the
successes of his party in Leinster and renewing his former
offers, forced him into action.<a id="Anchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 471.">[471]</a> He made a last appeal to
the king, intreating either for restoration of his lands or
for the royal license to go and repair his fortunes elsewhere.
Henry ironically bade him go, and he went.<a id="Anchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 472.">[472]</a> On <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bartholomew’s
eve, 1170, he landed at Waterford with twelve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">ii.104</a></span>
hundred men;<a id="Anchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 473.">[473]</a> next day he was joined by Raymond “the
Fat,” a young warrior whom he had sent over three months
before<a id="Anchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 474.">[474]</a> with ten knights and seventy archers, and who
with this small force had contrived to beat back an assault
of three thousand Irishmen of Decies and Ostmen of
Waterford upon his camp of wattle and thatch, hastily
thrown up on the rocky promontory of Dundonulf.<a id="Anchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 475.">[475]</a> On
August 25 Richard and Raymond attacked Waterford;
three assaults in one day carried both town and citadel;<a id="Anchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 476.">[476]</a>
seven hundred citizens were slaughtered,<a id="Anchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 477.">[477]</a> and the officers of
the fortress, whose names tell of northern blood, were made
prisoners.<a id="Anchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 478.">[478]</a> A few days later Richard was married at
Waterford to Dermot’s daughter Eva.<a id="Anchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 479.">[479]</a> He then joined his
father-in-law in a circuitous march across the hills and
through Glendalough,<a id="Anchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 480.">[480]</a> whereby they avoided a great host
which Roderic had gathered at Clondalkin to intercept
them, and arrived in safety on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Matthew’s day beneath
the walls of Dublin.<a id="Anchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 481.">[481]</a> Dermot sent his bard to demand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">ii.105</a></span>
the instant surrender of the town, with thirty hostages for
its fidelity. A dispute arose, probably between the Irish
and Danish inhabitants, as to the selection of the hostages;<a id="Anchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 482.">[482]</a>
Archbishop Laurence was endeavouring to compose the
difficulty,<a id="Anchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 483.">[483]</a> and Hasculf Thorgils’ son, a chieftain of northern
blood who commanded the citadel, had actually promised to
surrender it on the morrow,<a id="Anchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 484.">[484]</a> when a sudden attack made by
Raymond the Fat on one side and by a knight called Miles
Cogan on the other carried the town before the leaders of
either party knew what had happened.<a id="Anchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 485.">[485]</a> A second rush won
the citadel; Hasculf escaped by sea and took refuge in the
Orkneys;<a id="Anchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 486.">[486]</a> Dublin was sacked,<a id="Anchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 487.">[487]</a> and left throughout the
winter under the command of Miles Cogan,<a id="Anchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 488.">[488]</a> while Richard
of Striguil was guarding Waterford against the men of
Munster,<a id="Anchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 489.">[489]</a> and Dermot, from his old head-quarters at
Ferns,<a id="Anchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 490.">[490]</a> was making raid after raid upon Meath and
Breffny.<a id="Anchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 491.">[491]</a></p>

The cause of Richard’s disgrace seems to be nowhere stated, except by
    <cite>William of Newburgh</cite>.
He has
    (<cite><abbr title="book 2">l. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 26; Howlett, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 167, 168</cite>),
as usual, an independent version of the whole affair. According to him, Richard’s
chief motive for going to Ireland was to escape from his creditors, he being
deep in debt; he went in defiance of an express prohibition from Henry, and it
was on hearing of his victories—<i>i.e.</i> some time in the latter part of 1170—that
Henry confiscated his estates.
    <cite>Dugdale (<i>Baronage</i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 208)</cite> gives 1170
as the date of the forfeiture, on the authority of a <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> in the Bodleian library.

We are there told that Raymond
and his men had provided themselves with food by “lifting” all the cattle in the
neighbourhood and penning them within the camp. At the sound of arms these
creatures rushed out in a wild stampede, and it was this which put the assailants
to flight. On the site of Dundonulf see

<p>In vain did the Irish clergy meet in synod at Armagh
and strive to avert the wrath which seemed to have been
revealed against their country by a solemn decree for the
liberation of the English slaves with whom, even yet, the
houses of the Irish chieftains were filled.<a id="Anchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 492.">[492]</a> One sentence
from an Irish record of the next year may serve to illustrate
the condition of the country: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">ii.106</a></span>“Seven predatory excursions
were made by the Ui-Maine into Ormond from Palm Sunday
till Low Sunday.”<a id="Anchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 493.">[493]</a> It made but little difference when
at Whitsuntide Dermot, “by whom a trembling sod was
made of all Ireland,” died at Ferns “of an insufferable and
unknown disease—without a will, without penance, without
the Body of Christ, without unction, as his evil deeds deserved.”<a id="Anchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 494.">[494]</a>
At that very moment a wiking fleet gathered
from all the lands where the old sea-rovers’ life still lingered—Norway,
the Hebrides, Orkney, Man—appeared in Dublin
bay under the command of Hasculf, the exiled leader of
the Ostmen, and of a northern chief whose desperate valour
won him the title of “John the Furious”—in the English
speech of that day, John the Wode.<a id="Anchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 495.">[495]</a> Something of the
spirit of the old northern sagas breathes again in the story
of this, the last wiking-fight ever fought upon the soil of
the British isles. Bard and historian alike tell of the
mighty strokes dealt by the battle-axes of John and his
comrades,<a id="Anchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 496.">[496]</a> and how they had almost hewed their way into
Dublin once more, when a well-timed sally of the besieged
caught them at unawares in the rear;<a id="Anchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 497.">[497]</a>—how an Irish chief
named Gillamocholmog, whom Miles Cogan had posted on
a neighbouring hill, chivalrously bidding him watch the
course of the battle and join the winning side, rushed down
with his followers at the critical moment and helped to complete
the rout of the Ostmen;<a id="Anchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 498.">[498]</a>—how John the Wode fell by
the hand of Miles Cogan;<a id="Anchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 499.">[499]</a>—how Hasculf was taken prisoner
by Miles’s brother Richard and brought back to be reserved
for ransom, and how his hot wiking-blood spoke in words of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">ii.107</a></span>
defiance which goaded his captors to strike off his head.<a id="Anchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 500.">[500]</a>
Fifteen hundred northmen fell upon the field; five hundred
more were drowned in trying to regain their ships.<a id="Anchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 501.">[501]</a> From
the shores of Ireland, as from those of England, the last
northern fleet was driven away by Norman swords.</p>

<p>The garrison of Dublin fought in truth even more desperately
than their assailants; for they were fighting for
their all. A remonstrance addressed by some of the Irish
princes to the king of England against the aggressions of
his subjects<a id="Anchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 502.">[502]</a> can hardly have been needed to open Henry’s
eyes to the danger gathering for him and his realm beyond
the western sea. This little band of adventurers, almost all
bound together by the closest ties of kindred,<a id="Anchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 503.">[503]</a> were conquering
Leinster neither for its native sovereign nor for their
own, but were setting up a new feudal state independent of
all royal control, under the leadership of a disgraced English
baron. Such a state, if suffered to grow unhindered, would
soon be far more dangerous to England than to Ireland, for
it would be certain to play in every struggle of the feudal
principle against the royal authority in England the part
which the Ostmen had played of old in the struggles of the
Danelaw. At the beginning of the year 1171 therefore
Henry issued an edict prohibiting all further intermeddling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">ii.108</a></span>
of his subjects in Ireland, and bidding those who were
already there either return before Easter or consider themselves
banished for life.<a id="Anchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 504.">[504]</a> Not a man went back; Richard of
Striguil sent Raymond over to Normandy with a written
protest to the king, pleading that his conquests had been
undertaken with the royal sanction and that he was ready
to place them at the king’s disposal;<a id="Anchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 505.">[505]</a> but the “Geraldines,”

resolved to hold by their swords alone the lands which those
swords had won.<a id="Anchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 506.">[506]</a></p>

Raymond was back again
in time to share in the defence of Dublin against Roderic O’Conor—<i>i.e.</i> by the
end of May or beginning of June. Gerald says he had to seek the king in
“Aquitanic Gaul,” but this time the phrase cannot be taken literally.
    <cite>Eyton’s <i>Itinerary</i></cite>
shews plainly that throughout 1171 Henry never was further south than
the Norman, or, at the utmost, the Breton border.

<p>The hostility of the Ostmen had apparently ended with
Hasculf’s defeat; thenceforth they seem to have made
common cause with the new-comers in whom they were
perhaps already beginning to recognize the stirrings of
kindred blood. But, on the other hand, the position of Earl
Richard and his comrades had been seriously weakened by
Dermot’s death. The king of Leinster’s devise of his kingdom
to his son-in-law was, like the grants which he had
made to the Geraldines and like his own homage to King
Henry, void in Irish law. In Irish eyes his death removed
the last shadow of excuse for the presence of the strangers
on Irish soil; their allies rapidly fell away;<a id="Anchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 507.">[507]</a> and by midsummer
the whole country rose against them as one man.
Roderic O’Conor mustered the forces of the north; Archbishop
Laurence of Dublin, whose family occupied an
influential position in Leinster, called up the tribes of the
south; while a squadron of thirty ships was hired from Jarl
Godred of Man.<a id="Anchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 508.">[508]</a> The aim of the expedition was to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">ii.109</a></span>
blockade Dublin, whither Earl Richard had now returned,
and where almost all the leaders of the invasion, except
Robert Fitz-Stephen and Hervey of Mountmorris, were now
gathered together. The whole Irish land-force amounted to
sixty thousand men; half of these were under the immediate
command of Roderic, encamped at Castle-Knock;<a id="Anchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 509.">[509]</a> Mac-Dunlevy,
the chieftain of Uladh, planted his banner on the old
battle-field of Clontarf;<a id="Anchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 510.">[510]</a> Donell O’Brien, the king of North
Munster, posted himself at Kilmainham; and Murtogh Mac-Murrough,
a brother of Dermot, whom Roderic had set up as
king of Leinster in 1167, took up his position at Dalkey.<a id="Anchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 511.">[511]</a>
To these were added, for the northern division, the men of
Breffny and of East Meath under Tighernan O’Ruark, those
of Oiriel or southern Ulster under Murtogh O’Carroll,<a id="Anchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 512.">[512]</a> and
those of West Meath under Murtogh O’Melaghlin; while the
archbishop’s call had brought up the whole strength of
Leinster except the men of Wexford and Kinsellagh;<a id="Anchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 513.">[513]</a> and
even these, as the sequel proved, were preparing to fight the
same battle on other ground.</p>

<p>For nearly two months<a id="Anchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 514.">[514]</a> the English knights were thus
blockaded in Dublin. Their sole hope of relief was in
Robert Fitz-Stephen, who had been left in command at
Wexford. They were all but starving when Donell
Kavanagh, a half-brother of Eva Mac-Murrough and a
devoted adherent of her husband, slipped into the city with
tidings that Wexford had risen; Robert Fitz-Stephen was
blockaded in the little fort of Carrick by the townsfolk and
the men of Kinsellagh, to the number of three thousand;
unless he could be succoured within three days, all would be
over with him and his men.<a id="Anchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 515.">[515]</a> Earl Richard at once called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">ii.110</a></span>
a council of war. It comprised nearly all the leaders of the
English and Welsh forces in Ireland<span class="nobreak">:—</span>Richard of Striguil
himself; Maurice Fitz-Gerald with three of his gallant
nephews, Meiler Fitz-Henry, Miles Fitz-David and Raymond
the Fat; Miles Cogan, the captor of Dublin and its chief
defender in the recent siege; Maurice de Prendergast,<a id="Anchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 516.">[516]</a> who
two years before had thrown up the adventure and gone
home in disgust at the faithlessness of his allies,<a id="Anchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 517.">[517]</a> but had
returned, it seems, in Earl Richard’s train, and was yet
to leave, alone of all the invading band, an honoured memory
among the Irish people;<a id="Anchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 518.">[518]</a> and some fourteen others.<a id="Anchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 519.">[519]</a> They
decided upon sending Maurice de Prendergast and Archbishop
Laurence to Roderic with an offer of surrender on condition
that Richard of Striguil should hold the kingdom of
Leinster under Roderic as overlord. Roderic rejected the
proposal with scorn; the knights might hold what the
earlier pirates had held—Dublin, Waterford and Wexford;
not another rood of Irish land should be granted to the earl
and his company; and if they refused these terms, Dublin
should be stormed on the morrow.<a id="Anchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 520.">[520]</a> That afternoon the
little garrison—scarce six hundred in all<a id="Anchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 521.">[521]</a>—sallied forth and
surprized Roderic’s camp while he and his men were bathing;
Roderic himself escaped with great difficulty; fifteen hundred
Irishmen were slain, many of them perishing in the water;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">ii.111</a></span>
while at sunset the victors returned, after a long pursuit, with
scarcely a man missing, and laden with provisions enough to
supply all Dublin for a year.<a id="Anchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 522.">[522]</a> The rest of the besieging army
dispersed at once, and the very next morning Earl Richard
was free to set out for the relief of Robert Fitz-Stephen.<a id="Anchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 523.">[523]</a></p>

<p>He was however already too late. Three thousand men
of Wexford and Kinsellagh, finding that they could make no
impression by fair means upon Robert Fitz-Stephen shut up
in the fort of Carrick with five knights and a handful of
archers, at length had recourse to fraud. Two bishops and
some monks were made to stand under the walls of the fort
and swear upon relics brought for the purpose that Dublin
was taken, the earl and his comrades slain, and Roderic on
the march to Wexford at the head of his victorious host.
On a promise of liberty to escape to Wales<a id="Anchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 524.">[524]</a> Robert in his
despair surrendered, only to see his little band of humbler
followers slaughtered to a man, and himself and his five
knights cast into chains. The men of Wexford then fired
their town and took refuge with their captives on the
neighbouring island of Beg-Erin,<a id="Anchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 525.">[525]</a> whence they sent word to
Richard of Striguil that if he dared to approach them he
should immediately receive the heads of his six friends.<a id="Anchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 526.">[526]</a>
Notwithstanding this disaster at Wexford, and the failure of
a plot to entrap the chief of Ossory—a well-deserved failure,
due to the loyalty of Maurice de Prendergast<a id="Anchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 527.">[527]</a>—the
invaders were rapidly gaining ground. The king of North
Munster, who was married to Eva’s sister, again forsook
Roderic and made alliance with his English brother-in-law;<a id="Anchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 528.">[528]</a>
an attempt made by Tighernan O’Ruark to renew the siege of

was reduced to make a surrender of his principality into
Richard’s hands and accept a re-grant of it from him as
overlord, while Donell Kavanagh was invested on like
terms with the remaining portion of Leinster.<a id="Anchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 530.">[530]</a></p>

<p>The earl’s triumphs, however, met with an abrupt check
from over sea. His uncle Hervey of Mountmorris, who had
gone to plead his cause with the king after the failure of
Raymond’s mission, returned to Waterford<a id="Anchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 531.">[531]</a> with tidings that
Henry himself was on his way to Ireland and required the
self-styled earl of Leinster to go and speak with him without
delay. Richard hurried over to Wales,<a id="Anchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 532.">[532]</a> met Henry on the
border,<a id="Anchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 533.">[533]</a> and was forgiven on condition that he should surrender
Dublin and the other coast towns absolutely into the
king’s hands and do him homage and fealty for the rest of
Leinster;<a id="Anchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 534.">[534]</a> he then accompanied Henry into Pembrokeshire;<a id="Anchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 535.">[535]</a>
where the royal fleet was assembling in Milford Haven. It
consisted of four hundred ships,<a id="Anchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 536.">[536]</a> carrying a force of about
four thousand men, of whom some five hundred were knights
and the rest archers, mounted and unmounted.<a id="Anchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 537.">[537]</a> The king<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">ii.113</a></span>
embarked on the evening of Saturday, October 16, and
landed next day at Croch, eight miles from Waterford.<a id="Anchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 538.">[538]</a>
On the morrow, <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Luke’s day, he entered the town of
Waterford;<a id="Anchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 539.">[539]</a> there he was met by his seneschal William
Fitz-Aldhelm, his constable Humfrey de Bohun, Hugh de
Lacy, Robert Fitz-Bernard, and some other officers of his
household whom he had sent over to prepare for his coming.<a id="Anchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 540.">[540]</a>
The Irish of the district and the Ostmen of the town, in the
person of their chieftain Ragnald, made submission to him
as their sovereign;<a id="Anchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 541.">[541]</a> while Richard of Striguil formally
surrendered the place into the king’s hands and did homage
to him for the earldom of Leinster.<a id="Anchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 542.">[542]</a> The men of Wexford
now, according to an agreement which they had made with
Henry while he was waiting for a wind at Pembroke,<a id="Anchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 543.">[543]</a>
brought their captive Robert Fitz-Stephen to his sovereign’s
feet, to be by him dealt with as a rebel and a traitor. Henry
loaded him with reproaches and imprisoned him afresh, but
his anger was more assumed than real, and the captive was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">ii.114</a></span>
soon released.<a id="Anchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 544.">[544]</a> The submission of the English adventurers
was followed by that of the Irish princes. Dermot MacCarthy,
king of Cork or South Munster, was the first of
them who came to Henry’s feet at Waterford, swore him
fealty, gave hostages and promised tribute.<a id="Anchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 545.">[545]</a> On November
1<a id="Anchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 546.">[546]</a> Henry advanced to Lismore, and thence, two days later,
to Cashel, where at the passage of the Suir he was met by
the king of Limerick or of Northern Munster, Donell O’Brien,
with offers of tribute and obedience. The lesser chieftains
of southern Ireland followed the example of the two kings;
in three weeks from his arrival all Munster was at his feet,

He adds that Henry returned
to Waterford, where he released Robert Fitz-Stephen, and thence proceeded to
Dublin. The
    <cite><abbr title="Anglo-Norman">Anglo-Norm.</abbr> Poem (Michel), <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 126, 127</cite>,
places this progress
through Cashel and Lismore in inverse order, after Henry’s first visit to Dublin,
and says nothing of a second visit to Waterford. Its account is however much less
circumstantial than Gerald’s. The
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Gesta Henrici">Gesta Hen.</abbr></i></cite> and
    <cite><abbr title="Roger of">Rog.</abbr> Howden</cite> only name two

reached the latter at Martinmas, while Roger says he left Waterford when he had

very well.

    <cite>Gerald (as above, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 33, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 278)</cite>
enumerates the princes who submitted
at Dublin as follows: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Machelanus Ophelan [<span lang="en" xml:lang="en">O’Phelan</span>], Machtalewi,
Otuetheli [<span lang="en" xml:lang="en">O’Toole</span>], Gillemoholmoch [<span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Gillamocholmog of Fingal by Dublin—see

Oiriel</span>], et Ororicius Medensis [<span lang="en" xml:lang="en">O’Ruark</span>]”</span>. He then relates the half-submission
of Roderic of Connaught (of which more later), and adds: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic itaque, præter
solos Ultonienses, subditi per se singuli</span>.”
    (<cite><i><abbr title="Ibid.">Ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 279</cite>.)
He need not however have excepted the Ulstermen; for the
    <cite><abbr title="Annals of">Ann.</abbr> Loch Cé, <abbr title="year">a.</abbr> 1171 (Hennessy, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr>

that Henry while at Dublin received hostages from “Leinster,
Meath, Breffny, Oiriel and Uladh.” This leaves only Connaught and Aileach
unsubdued.

all, as well as the submission of the bishops, during Henry’s stay in Waterford.

not only does the same still more distinctly,
but he does worse; he places the submission of the bishops first, and then says
that the lay princes submitted “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">exemplo clericorum</span>.” It is he, not Gerald or any
one else, who is responsible for this misrepresentation, which the champions of the
Irish Church have been justly denouncing ever since Dr. Lynch’s time.

objects that this can only have been done some time later, as
Henry’s communications were cut off by the weather. But this is not borne out
either by the words of
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Ralf de Diceto">R. Diceto</abbr> (Stubbs, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 350)</cite>

They both say distinctly
that a persistent contrary wind hindered all communication <i>from England to Ireland</i>.
For communication in the opposite direction such a wind would surely be
most favourable. Moreover, it is quite certain that the Pope did, some time before
September 20, 1172, receive reports of Henry’s proceedings in Ireland both from
Henry himself and from the Irish bishops, for he says so in three letters—one
addressed to Henry, another to the kings and bishops of Ireland, and the third to
the legate, Christian bishop of Lismore—all dated Tusculum, September 20, and
all printed in
    <cite>Hearne’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Niger</i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 42–48</cite>,

<p>In all Ireland the king of Connaught was now the
only ruler, spiritual or temporal, who had not submitted
to Henry.<a id="Anchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 557.">[557]</a> Trusting to the inaccessible nature of his
country,<a id="Anchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 558.">[558]</a> Roderic had at first refused all dealings with the
invader, declaring that he himself was the sole rightful
monarch of Ireland.<a id="Anchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 559.">[559]</a> It seems however that he afterwards
came to a meeting with William Fitz-Aldhelm and Hugh de
Lacy by the banks of the Shannon, on the frontier of
Connaught and Meath, and there promised tribute and fealty
like his fellow-kings.<a id="Anchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 560.">[560]</a> The promise was however worthless
until confirmed by his personal homage; and this Henry
soon perceived was only to be extorted at the sword’s point.
The impossibility of fighting to any advantage in the wet
Irish winter compelled him to postpone the attempt until
the spring;<a id="Anchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 561.">[561]</a> and when spring came he found that his
intended campaign must be abandoned altogether. From
the day when he left Milford he had received not one word
of tidings from any part of his dominions.<a id="Anchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 562.">[562]</a> This total
isolation, welcome at first as a relief from the load of cares<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">ii.117</a></span>
which indeed he had purposely left behind him,<a id="Anchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 563.">[563]</a> became at
the end of nineteen weeks a source of almost unbearable
anxiety. On March 1 he removed from Dublin to Wexford;<a id="Anchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 564.">[564]</a>
there for nearly a month he remained eagerly watching for
a ship from England; none came until after Mid-Lent,<a id="Anchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 565.">[565]</a> and
then it was laden with such ill news that he could only take
such hasty measures as were possible at the moment for
maintaining his hold upon Ireland, and prepare to hurry out
of it as soon as the wind would carry him.<a id="Anchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 566.">[566]</a> Richard of Striguil
was suffered to remain at Kildare<a id="Anchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 567.">[567]</a> as earl of Leinster;
the general direction of government and administration
throughout the king’s Irish domains was intrusted to Hugh
de Lacy,<a id="Anchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 568.">[568]</a> who had already received a grant of Meath in fee,<a id="Anchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 569.">[569]</a>
and who was also left in command of the citadel of Dublin,<a id="Anchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 570.">[570]</a>
with a garrison of twenty knights, among whom were
Maurice Fitz-Gerald<a id="Anchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 571.">[571]</a> and Robert Fitz-Stephen.<a id="Anchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 572.">[572]</a> The
grants of territory made by Dermot to the half-brothers were
of course annulled; Waterford and Wexford were both
garrisoned and placed in charge of an officer appointed by
the king;<a id="Anchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 573.">[573]</a> and in each of these towns a fortress was either
erected or repaired by his orders.<a id="Anchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 574.">[574]</a></p>

<p>A better mode of securing his authority in Dublin was
probably suggested to him by the ravages which war and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">ii.118</a></span>
famine had made among its population. Eight years before
he had taken the burghers of Bristol, so long the medium of
trading intercourse between England and Ireland, under his
especial patronage and protection.<a id="Anchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 575.">[575]</a> He now granted to
them the city of Dublin, to colonize and to hold of him and
his heirs by the same free customs which they enjoyed in
their own town of Bristol.<a id="Anchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 576.">[576]</a> It is plain that Henry was
already aiming at something far other than a mere military
conquest of Ireland; and the long and varied list of English
names, from all parts of the country, which is found in a roll
of the Dublin citizens only a few years later,<a id="Anchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 577.">[577]</a> shews how
willingly his plans were taken up, not only at Bristol but
throughout his realm, by the class to which he chiefly and
rightly trusted for aid in their execution. Unluckily, they
were scarcely formed when he was obliged to leave their
developement to other hands; and the consequence was a
half success which proved in the end to be far worse than
total failure. On Easter night<a id="Anchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 578.">[578]</a> he sailed from Wexford;<a id="Anchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 579.">[579]</a>
next day he landed at Portfinnan, hard by <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> David’s;<a id="Anchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 580.">[580]</a>
before the octave was out he had hurried through South<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">ii.119</a></span>
Wales to Newport;<a id="Anchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 581.">[581]</a> in a few days more he was at Portsmouth;<a id="Anchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 582.">[582]</a>
and before Rogation-tide he was once more in
Normandy, ready to face the bursting of a storm whose
consequences were to overshadow all his remaining years
and to preclude all chance of his return to complete his
conquest of Ireland.</p>

<span class="ch1">CHAPTER <abbr title="4">IV.</abbr></span><br />

<span class="ch2">HENRY AND THE BARONS.</span><br />

<span class="ch3">1166–1175.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">For</span> the last eight years Henry had been literally, throughout
his English realm, over all persons and all causes
supreme. From the hour of Thomas’s flight, not a hand,
not a voice was lifted to oppose or to question his will;
England lay passive before him; the time seemed to have
come when he might work out at leisure and without fear of
check his long-cherished plans of legal, judicial and administrative
reform. In the execution of those plans, however,
he was seriously hampered by the indirect consequences of
the ecclesiastical quarrel. One of these was his own prolonged
absence from England, which was made necessary by
the hostility of France, and which compelled him to be
content with setting his reforms in operation and then leave
their working to other hands and other heads, without the
power of superintending it and watching its effects with his
own eyes, during nearly six years. He had now to learn
that the enemy with whom he had been striving throughout
those years was after all not the most serious obstacle in
his way;—that the most threatening danger to his scheme
of government still lay, as it had lain at his accession, in that
temper of the baronage which it had been his first kingly
task to bring under subjection. The victory which he had
gained over Hugh Bigod in 1156 was real, but it was not
final. The spirit of feudal insubordination was checked, not
crushed; it was only waiting an opportunity to lift its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">ii.121</a></span>
head once more; and with the strife that raged around <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Thomas of Canterbury the opportunity came.</p>

<p>Henry’s attitude towards the barons during these years
had been of necessity a somewhat inconsistent one. He
never lost sight of the main thread of policy which he had
inherited from his grandfather: a policy which may be
defined as the consolidation of kingly power in his own
hands, through the repression of the feudal nobles and the
raising of the people at large into a condition of greater
security and prosperity, and of closer connexion with and
dependence upon the Crown, as a check and counterpoise to
the territorial influence of the feudataries. On the other
hand, his quarrel with the primate had driven him to throw
himself on the support of those very feudataries whom it was
his true policy to repress, and had brought him into hostility
with the ecclesiastical interest which ought to have been, and
which actually had been until now, his surest and most
powerful aid. If it was what we may perhaps venture
to call the feudal side of the ecclesiastical movement—its
introduction of a separate system of law and jurisdiction,
traversing and impeding the course of his own uniform regal
administration—which roused the suspicions of the king, it
was its anti-feudal side, its championship of the universal
rights and liberties of men in the highest and widest sense,
that provoked the jealousy of the nobles. This was a point
which Henry, blinded for the moment by his natural instinct
of imperiousness, seems to have overlooked when at the
council of Northampton he stooped to avail himself of the
assistance of the barons to crush the primate. They doubtless
saw what he failed to see, that he was crushing not so
much his own rival as theirs. The cause of the Church was
bound up with that of the people, and both alike were closely
knit to that of the Crown. Sceptre and crozier once parted,
the barons might strive with the former at an advantage
such as they had never had while Lanfranc stood beside
William and Anselm beside Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, such as they never
could have had if Thomas had remained standing by the
side of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr><a id="Anchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 583.">[583]</a></p>

“The government party was made up of two elements—the higher order of
the Clergy, who joined the king out of cowardice, having more at stake than they
could make up their minds to lose; and the higher order of the Laity, who in this
instance sided with the king against the Church, that when they had removed this
obstacle they might afterwards fight him single-handed.”

<p>As yet, however, there was no token of the strife to
come. In February 1166, two years after the publication
of the Constitutions of Clarendon, Henry assembled another
council at the same place and thence issued an ordinance<a id="Anchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 584.">[584]</a>
for carrying out a reform in the method of bringing to
justice criminals in general, similar to that which he had in
the Constitutions sought to apply to criminals of one particular
class. By the Assize of Clarendon it was enacted
that the king’s justices and the sheriffs should in every shire
throughout the kingdom make inquiry concerning all crimes
therein committed “since our lord the king was king.”<a id="Anchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 585.">[585]</a>
The method of their investigations was that of inquest by
sworn recognitors chosen from among the “lawful men” of
each hundred and township, and bound by oath to speak
the truth according to their knowledge of the fact in question.
This mode of legal inquiry had been introduced into
England by William the Conqueror for fiscal purposes, such
as the taking of the Domesday survey, and its employment
for similar objects was continued by his successors. Henry
<abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> had in the early years of his reign applied the same
principle to the uses of civil litigation by an ordinance
known as the “Great Assize,” whereby disputes concerning
the possession of land might, if the litigants chose, be settled
before the justices of the king’s court by the unanimous
oath of twelve lawful knights chosen according to a prescribed
form from among those dwelling in the district
where the land lay, and therefore competent to swear to the
truth or falsehood of the claim.<a id="Anchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 586.">[586]</a> This proceeding seems to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">ii.123</a></span>
be assumed as already in use by the ninth Constitution of
Clarendon, which ordains its application to disputes concerning
Church lands.<a id="Anchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 587.">[587]</a> The Assize of Clarendon aimed at
bringing criminals to justice by the help of the same
machinery. It decreed that in every hundred of every shire
inquest should be made by means of twelve lawful men of
the hundred and four from each township, who should be
sworn to denounce every man known in their district as
a robber, thief or murderer, or a harbourer of such; on their
presentment the accused persons were to be arrested by the
sheriff, and kept by him in safe custody till they could
be brought before the itinerant justices, to undergo the
ordeal of water and receive legal punishment according to
its results.<a id="Anchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 588.">[588]</a> The inquest was to be taken and the session of
the justices held in full shire-court; no personal privileges
of any kind were to exempt any qualified member of the
court from his duty of attendance and of service on the jury
of recognitors if required;<a id="Anchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 589.">[589]</a> and no territorial franchise or
private jurisdiction, whether of chartered town or feudal
“honour,” was to shelter a criminal thus accused from the
pursuit of the sheriffs on the authority of the justices.<a id="Anchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 590.">[590]</a></p>

<p>As was the case with most of Henry’s reforms, none of
the methods of procedure adopted in this Assize were new
inventions. Not only had the inquest by sworn recognitors
been in use for civil purposes ever since the Norman conquest;
it may even be that the germ of a jury of presentment
in criminal cases, which in its modern shape appears
for the first time in the Assize of Clarendon, is to be traced
yet further back, to an ordinance of Æthelred <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, whereby
the twelve senior thegns in every wapentake were made to
swear that they would “accuse no innocent man nor conceal
any guilty one.”<a id="Anchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 591.">[591]</a> The mission of itinerant justices—derived
in principle from the early days of English kingship,
when the sovereign himself perambulated his whole realm,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">ii.124</a></span>
hearing and deciding whatever cause came before him as he
passed along—had been employed by Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, and revived
by Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> immediately after his accession. A visitation
of the greater part of England had been made by two of the
chief officers of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia Regis</span> in the first year of his reign,
and again in the second; another circuit seems to have been
made in 1159 by William Fitz-John; and in 1163 Alan de
Neville held pleas of the forest in Oxfordshire, while the
justiciar himself, Richard de Lucy, made a journey into
Cumberland to hold the pleas of the Crown there, for the
first time since the district had passed into the hands of the
king of Scots.<a id="Anchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 592.">[592]</a> From the date of the Assize of Clarendon,
however, these journeys became regular and general,<a id="Anchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 593.">[593]</a> and
the work of the judges employed on them became far more
extensive and important.</p>

<p>The first visitation under the assize was at once begun
by Richard de Lucy and Geoffrey de Mandeville, earl of
Essex;<a id="Anchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 594.">[594]</a> and the Pipe Roll of the year furnishes some indications
of its immediate results. The sums credited to the
treasury for the pleas of the Crown reach a far greater
amount than in the earlier rolls, and its receipts are further
swelled by the goods and chattels of criminals condemned
under the assize,<a id="Anchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 595.">[595]</a> which were explicitly declared forfeit to
the king.<a id="Anchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 596.">[596]</a> The clause binding all qualified persons to be
ready to serve on the juries was strictly enforced; one
attempt to evade it was punished with a fine of five marks.<a id="Anchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 597.">[597]</a>
Another clause, enjoining upon the sheriffs the construction
and repair of gaols for the detention of criminals, was carried
into effect with equal vigour.<a id="Anchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 598.">[598]</a> The work of the two justiciars
was apparently not completed till the summer of 1167.<a id="Anchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 599.">[599]</a> In
that year pleas of the forest were held throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">ii.125</a></span>
country by Alan de Neville; and in 1168 seven barons of
the Exchequer made a general visitation of the shires for the
collection of an aid on the marriage of the king’s eldest
daughter.<a id="Anchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 600.">[600]</a> This last was primarily a fiscal journey; the aid
itself was a strictly feudal impost, assessed at one mark on
every knight’s fee.<a id="Anchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 601.">[601]</a> It was however levied in a remarkable
manner. The Domesday survey, which by a few modifications
in practice had been made to serve as the rate-book
of the whole kingdom for eighty years, was at last found
inadequate for the present purpose. A royal writ was therefore
addressed to all the tenants-in-chief, requiring from them
an account of the knights’ fees which they held and the
services due upon them, whether under the “old infeoffment”
of the time of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, or under the “new infeoffment”
since the resettlement of the country by his grandson.<a id="Anchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 602.">[602]</a> The
answers were enrolled in what is known as the <cite><i>Black Book
of the Exchequer</i></cite><a id="Anchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 603.">[603]</a> and the aid was levied in accordance with
their contents. The whole process occupied a considerable
time; the preparations seem to have begun shortly after
Matilda’s betrothal, for we hear of the purchase of “a hutch
for keeping the barons’ letters concerning their knights” as
early as 1166,<a id="Anchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 604.">[604]</a> yet the collection of the money was not
finished till the summer of 1169,<a id="Anchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 605.">[605]</a> a year and a half after her
marriage. The labours of the barons employed in it were
however not confined to this one end; as usual, their travels
were turned to account for judicial purposes,<a id="Anchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 606.">[606]</a> and the system
begun by the assize of Clarendon was by no means suffered
to fall into disuse.</p>

<p>It was too soon as yet for the beneficial results of these
measures to become evident to the people at large; but it
was not too soon for them to excite the resentment of the
barons. The stringency with which in the assize of Clarendon
every claim of personal exemption or special jurisdiction
was made to give way before the all-embracing authority of
the king’s supreme justice shewed plainly that Henry still
clave to the policy which had led him to insist upon the
restoration of alienated lands and the surrender of unlicensed
castles in England, to lose no opportunity of exercising
his ducal right to seize and garrison the castles of his
vassals in Normandy<a id="Anchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 607.">[607]</a>—in a word, to check and thwart in
every possible way the developement of the feudal principle.
The assessment of the aid for his daughter’s marriage seems
indeed at first glance to have been based on a principle
wholly favourable to the barons, for it apparently left the
determination of each landowner’s liabilities wholly in his
own hands. But the commissioners who spent nearly two
years in collecting the aid had ample power and ample
opportunity to check any irregularities which might have
occurred in the returns; and the impost undoubtedly pressed
very heavily upon the feudal tenants as a body. Its proceeds
seem, however, not to have come up to Henry’s
expectations, and the unsatisfactory reports which reached
him from England of the general results of his legal measures
led him to suspect some failure in duty on the part of those
who were charged with their execution.</p>

<p>A large share of responsibility rested with the sheriffs;
and the sheriffs were still for the most part, as they had
been in his grandfather’s days, the chief landowners in their
respective shires, men of great local importance, and only
too likely to have at once the will and the power to defeat
the ends of the very measures which by their official position
they were called upon to administer. Henry therefore on
his return to England at Easter 1170 summarily deposed all
sheriffs of counties and bailiffs of royal demesnes, pending
an inquisition into all the details of their official conduct
since his own departure over sea four years ago. The inquiry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">ii.127</a></span>
was intrusted not to any of the usual members of
the King’s Court and Exchequer, but to a large body of
commissioners specially chosen for the purpose from the
higher ranks of both clergy and laity.<a id="Anchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 608.">[608]</a> These were to
take pledges of all the sheriffs and bailiffs that they would
be ready to appear before the king and make redress on
an appointed day; an oath was also to be exacted from
all barons, knights and freemen in every shire that they
would answer truthfully and without respect of persons to
all questions put to them by the commissioners in the
king’s name.<a id="Anchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 609.">[609]</a></p>

<p>The subject-matter of these inquiries, as laid down in
the king’s instructions, embraced far more than the conduct
of the sheriffs. Not only were the commissioners to examine
into all particulars of the sums received by the sheriffs and
bailiffs in the discharge of their functions, and the manner
and grounds of their acquisition,<a id="Anchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 610.">[610]</a> and into the disposal of all
chattels and goods forfeited under the assize of Clarendon;
they were also to ascertain whether the collection of the aid
<i>pour fille marier</i> had been honestly conducted; they were
at the same time to investigate the administration of the
forests<a id="Anchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 611.">[611]</a> and the condition of the royal demesnes;<a id="Anchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 612.">[612]</a> to find
out and report any persons who had failed to do homage to
the king or his son;<a id="Anchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 613.">[613]</a> and they were moreover to make inquisition
into the proceedings of all the special courts of the
various franchises, whether held by archbishop or bishop,
abbot, earl or baron, as fully and minutely as into those of
the ordinary hundreds.<a id="Anchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 614.">[614]</a> Only two months were allowed to
the commissioners for their work, which nothing but their
great number can have enabled them to execute in the time.
Unhappily, the report which they brought up to the king on
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Barnabas’s day is lost, and we have no record of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">ii.128</a></span>
results save in relation to one point: out of twenty-seven
sheriffs, only seven were allowed to retain their offices. The
rest, who were mostly local magnates owing their importance
rather to their territorial and family influence than to their
connexion with the court, were replaced by men of inferior
rank, and of whom all but four were officials of the
Exchequer.<a id="Anchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 615.">[615]</a></p>

<p>This significant proof of Henry’s determination to pursue
his anti-feudal policy was followed up next year by the last
step in that resumption of alienated demesnes which in
England had been virtually completed thirteen years ago,
but which had been enforced only by slower degrees on the
other side of the channel. In 1171 Henry ordered a
general inquisition into the extent and condition of the
demesne lands and forests held by his grandfather in Normandy,
and into the encroachments since made upon them
by the barons; and we are told that the restitution which
resulted from the inquiry almost doubled his ducal revenue.<a id="Anchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 616.">[616]</a>
The endurance of the barons was now almost at an end;
and moreover, their opportunity had now come. From that
same council at Westminster whence the decree had gone
forth for the inquest of sheriffs, there had gone forth also the
summons for the crowning of the young king; that other
assembly which on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Barnabas’s day saw the deposition of
the delinquent officers saw also, three days later, the new
and dangerously suggestive spectacle of two kings at once in
the land. When, six months later still, the first consequences
of that coronation appeared in the murder of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas, the
barons could not but feel that their hour was at hand. His
regal dignity no longer all his own, but voluntarily shared
with another—his regal unction washed out in that stream
of martyr’s blood which cut him off from the support of the
Church—Henry seemed to be left alone and defenceless in
the face of his foes. The year which he spent in conquering
Ireland was a breathing-space for them as well as for him.
They used it to adapt to their purposes the weapon which
he had so lately forged for his own defence; they found a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">ii.129</a></span>
rallying-point and a pretext for their designs against him in
the very son whom he had left to cover his retreat and
supply his place at home.</p>

<p>The younger Henry had passed over to Normandy just
before his father quitted it, in July 1171.<a id="Anchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 617.">[617]</a> There he apparently
stayed with his mother and her younger children
till the opening of the next year, when he and his wife
went to England, and there remained as titular king and queen
until his father’s return from Ireland.<a id="Anchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 618.">[618]</a> The youth’s kingship,
however, was scarcely more than nominal; in his presence
no less than in his absence, the real work of government in
England was done by the justiciars; and his own personal
interests lay chiefly beyond the sea. The influences which
surrounded him there were those of his father’s open or
secret foes<span class="nobreak">:—</span>of his wife’s father, King Louis of France, of
his own mother, Queen Eleanor, her kindred and her people;
and Eleanor had ceased to be a loyal vice-gerent for the
husband who had by this time forfeited his claims to wifely
affection from her. She seems to have taken for her political
confidant her uncle, Ralf of Faye<a id="Anchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 619.">[619]</a>—one of the many faithless
barons of Poitou; and it is said to have been at her
instigation that Ralf and an Angevin baron, Hugh of <abbr title="Sainte-Maure">Ste.-Maure</abbr>,
profited by Henry’s absence in Ireland to whisper to
her eldest son that a crown was worthless without the reality
of kingly power, and that it was time for him to assert his
claim to the substance of which his father had given him
only the shadow.<a id="Anchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 620.">[620]</a> Young Henry, now seventeen years old,
listened but too readily to such suggestions; and it was a
rumour of his undutiful temper, coupled significantly with
a rumour of growing discontent among the barons, that
called Henry back from Ireland<a id="Anchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 621.">[621]</a> and made him carry his
son with him to Normandy<a id="Anchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 622.">[622]</a> in the spring of 1172. After
the elder king’s reconciliation with the Church, however, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">ii.130</a></span>
the second coronation of the younger one, the danger seemed
to have subsided; and in November Henry, to complete the
pacification, allowed his son to accompany his girl-wife on
a visit to her father, the king of France.<a id="Anchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 623.">[623]</a> When they returned,<a id="Anchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 624.">[624]</a>
the young king at once confronted his father with a
demand to be put in possession of his heritage, or at least of
some portion of it—England, Normandy, or Anjou—where
he might dwell as an independent sovereign with his queen.<a id="Anchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 625.">[625]</a>
The father refused.<a id="Anchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 626.">[626]</a> He had never intended to make his
sons independent rulers of the territories allotted to them;
Richard and Geoffrey indeed were too young for such an
arrangement to be possible in their cases; and the object of
the eldest son’s crowning had been simply to give him such
an inchoate royalty as would enable his father to employ
him as a colleague and representative in case of need, and to
feel assured of his ultimate succession to the English throne.
The king’s plans for the distribution of his territories and for
the establishment of his children had succeeded well thus
far. He had secured Britanny in Geoffrey’s name before he
quitted Gaul in 1171; and a month after his return, on
Trinity Sunday (June 10) 1172, Richard was enthroned as
duke of Aquitaine according to ancient custom in the abbot’s
chair in the church of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Hilary at Poitiers.<a id="Anchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 627.">[627]</a> One child,
indeed, the youngest of all, was still what his father had
called him at his birth—“John Lackland.”<a id="Anchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 628.">[628]</a> Even for John,
however, though he was scarcely five years old,<a id="Anchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 629.">[629]</a> a politic
marriage was already in view.</p>

<p>One of the many branches of Henry’s continental policy
was the cultivation of an alliance with those small but
important states which lay on the border-land between Italy,
Germany, and that old Aquitanic Gaul over which he
claimed dominion in his wife’s name. The most important
of these was the county of Maurienne, a name which in
strictness represents only a small mountainous region encircled
to east and south by the Graian and Cottian Alps, and to
west and north by another chain of mountains bordering the
outermost edges of two river-valleys, those of the Isère and
the Arc, which again are severed from each other by a line
of lesser heights running through the heart of the district.
In the southern valley, that of the Arc, stood the capital of
the county, <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Jean-de-Maurienne, the seat of a bishopric
from the dedication of whose cathedral church the town
itself took its name. In the northern valley, at the foot of
the Little <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard, some few miles above the source of the
Isère, the counts of Maurienne were advocates of the abbey
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Maurice, which long treasured the sacred symbol of the
old Burgundian royalty, the spear of its patron saint. The
power of the counts of Maurienne, however, was not bounded
by the narrow circle of hills which stood like an impregnable
rampart round about their native land. On the shore of the
lake of Bourget they held Chambéry, guarding the pass of
Les Echelles, through which southern Gaul communicated
with the German lands around the lake of Geneva; the
county of Geneva itself was almost surrounded by their
territories, for on its western side their sway extended from
Chambéry across the valley of the Rhône northward as far
as Belley, while eastward they held the whole southern
shore of the lake. To north-east of Maurienne, again, the
great highway which led from Geneva and from the German
lands beyond it into Italy, through the vale of Aosta by the
passes of the Pennine Alps or up the valley of the Isère by
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Maurice under the foot of the Little <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard, was in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">ii.132</a></span>
their hands; for Aosta itself and the whole land as far
as Castiglione on the Dora Baltea belonged to them.
Across the Graian Alps, their possession of the extreme outposts
of the Italian border, Susa and Turin, gave them the
title of “Marquises of Italy,”<a id="Anchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 630.">[630]</a> and the command of the great
highway between Italy and southern Gaul by the valley of
the Durance and through the gap which parts the Cottian
from the Maritime Alps beneath the foot of the Mont
Genèvre; while yet further south, on either side of the
Maritime Alps where they curve eastward towards the Gulf
of Genoa, Chiusa, Rochetta and Aspromonte all formed part
of their territories.<a id="Anchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 631.">[631]</a> In one word, they held the keys of
every pass between Italy and north-western Europe, from
the Great <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard to the Col di Tenda. Nominally
subject to the Emperor in his character of king of Burgundy,
they really possessed the control over his most direct lines
of communication with his Imperial capital; while the intercourse
of western Europe with Rome lay almost wholly at
their mercy;<a id="Anchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 632.">[632]</a> and far away at the opposite extremity of
Aquitania the present count Humbert of Maurienne seems
to have claimed, though he did not actually hold, one of the
keys of another great mountain-barrier, in the Pyrenean
county of Roussillon on the Spanish March.<a id="Anchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 633.">[633]</a></p>

1172,<a id="Anchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 637.">[637]</a> and soon afterwards Henry summoned his eldest
son to join him in a journey into Auvergne for a personal
meeting with Humbert. They reached Montferrand before
Candlemas, and were there met not only by Humbert and
his daughter but also by the count of Vienne,<a id="Anchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 638.">[638]</a> the count of
Toulouse and the king of Aragon.<a id="Anchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 639.">[639]</a> How high the English
king’s influence had now risen in these southern lands may
be judged by the fact that not only King Alfonso of Aragon,
a son of his old ally Raymond-Berengar, but also his former
enemy Raymond of Toulouse, could agree to choose him as
arbiter in a quarrel between themselves.<a id="Anchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 640.">[640]</a> Raymond in truth
saw in Henry’s alliances with Aragon and Maurienne a
death-blow to his own hopes of maintaining the independence
of Toulouse. Hemmed in alike to south and
east by close allies of the English king whose own duchy
of Aquitaine surrounded almost the whole of its north-western
border, the house of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Gilles felt that it was no
longer possible to resist his claim to overlordship over its
territories. Henry carried his guests back with him to
Limoges; there he settled the dispute between Raymond
and Alfonso; and there Raymond did homage to the two
Henrys for Toulouse,<a id="Anchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 641.">[641]</a> promising to do the like at Whitsuntide
to Richard as duke of Aquitaine, and pledging
himself to military service and yearly tribute.<a id="Anchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 642.">[642]</a></p>

<p>The infant heiress of Maurienne was now placed under
the care of her intended father-in-law;<a id="Anchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 643.">[643]</a> Henry’s political
schemes seemed to have all but reached their fulfilment,
when suddenly Count Humbert asked what provision Henry
intended to make for the little landless bridegroom to whom
he himself was giving such a well-dowered bride.<a id="Anchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 644.">[644]</a> That
question stirred up a trouble which was never again to be
laid wholly to rest till the child who was its as yet innocent
cause had broken his father’s heart. Henry proposed to
endow John with the castles and territories of Chinon,
Loudun and Mirebeau.<a id="Anchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 645.">[645]</a> But the Angevin lands, with which
the younger Henry had been formally invested, could not
be dismembered without his consent; and this he angrily
refused.<a id="Anchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 646.">[646]</a> The mere request, however, kindled his smouldering
discontent into a flame<a id="Anchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 647.">[647]</a> which seems to have been fanned
rather than quenched by the suggestions of Eleanor; yet so
blind was the indulgent father that, if we may venture to
believe the tale, nothing but a warning from Raymond of
Toulouse opened his eyes to the danger which threatened
him from the plots of his own wife and children. Then, by
Raymond’s advice, he started off at once with a small escort,
under pretence of a hunting-party,<a id="Anchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 648.">[648]</a> and carried his son back
towards Normandy with the utmost possible speed. They
reached Chinon about Mid-Lent; thence young Henry slipped
away secretly by night to Alençon; his father flew after
him, but when he reached Alençon on the next evening the
son was already at Argentan; and thence before cock-crow
he fled again over the French border, to the court of his
father-in-law King Louis.<a id="Anchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 649.">[649]</a> Henry in vain sent messengers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">ii.135</a></span>
to recall him: “Your master is king no longer—here stands
the king of the English!” was the reply of Louis to the
envoys.<a id="Anchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 650.">[650]</a></p>

    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Ralf de Diceto">R. Diceto</abbr> (as above), <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 355</cite>.
The
chronology is here in great confusion. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta</i> tell us that the two kings
reached Chinon just before Mid-Lent (which in 1173 was on March 16), that
young Henry was next day at Alençon, the day after that at Argentan, and that
on the third night, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa gallicantum</span>,” he went off again, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">octavâ Idus Martii,
feriâ quintâ ante mediam Quadragesimam</span>.” (In
    <cite>the printed edition by Bishop Stubbs—<abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 42</cite>—
the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mediam</i> has been accidentally omitted; see
    <cite>note
to his edition of <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Ralf de Diceto">R. Diceto</abbr>, <abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="preface">pref.</abbr> <abbr title="page 36">p. xxxvi</abbr>, note 6)</cite>.
It is of course impossible
to make anything of such a contradiction as this. On the other hand, <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Ralf de Diceto">R. Diceto</abbr>
gives only one date, that of the young king’s flight from Argentan, which he
places on March 23. Now in 1173 March 23 was the Friday after Mid-Lent
Sunday. Reckoning backwards from this—<i>i.e.</i> from the night of Thursday-Friday,
March 22–23, for it is plain that the flight took place before daybreak—we
should find the young king at Alençon on Wednesday, March 21, and at
Chinon on Tuesday, March 20; that is, four days after Mid-Lent. It looks very
much as if the author or the scribe of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta</i> had written “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span>” instead of
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</span>” twice over.

<p>Henry at once made a circuit of his Norman fortresses,
especially those which lay along the French border, put
them in a state of defence, and issued orders to all his
castellans in Anjou, Britanny, Aquitaine and England, to
do the like.<a id="Anchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 651.">[651]</a> Before Lent had closed the old prophecy
which Henry’s enemies were never weary of casting in his

seeking to make him their prey.<a id="Anchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 652.">[652]</a> Whether sent by their

purchase allies among the French feudataries and supporters
among the English and Norman barons, by making grants

<p>Nearly three months passed away before war actually
broke out; but when the outburst came, the list of those
who were engaged in it shews that the whole Angevin
empire had become a vast hotbed of treason; though, on
the other hand, it shews also that the treason was almost
entirely confined to one especial class. Its local distribution,
too, is significant. The restless barons of Aquitaine,
still smarting under their defeat of 1169, were but too eager,
at the instigation of their duchess and their newly-crowned
duke, to renew their struggle against the king. Foremost
among them were, as before, the count of Angoulême,<a id="Anchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 660.">[660]</a> the
nobles of Saintonge, and Geoffrey of Lusignan, beside whom
there stood this time his young brother Guy, now to begin
in this ignoble strife a career destined to strange vicissitudes
in far-off Palestine.<a id="Anchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 661.">[661]</a> The heart of the old Angevin lands,
Anjou itself, was in the main loyal; we find there the names
of only five traitors; and three of these, Hugh, William
and Jocelyn of <abbr title="Sainte-Maure">Ste.-Maure</abbr>, came of a rebellious house, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">ii.137</a></span>
were only doing over again what their predecessors had
done in the days of Geoffrey Plantagenet’s youth.<a id="Anchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 662.">[662]</a> The
same may be said of Henry’s native land, Maine; this too
furnished only seven barons to the traitor’s cause; and five
of these again are easily accounted for. It was almost
matter of course that in any rising against an Angevin count
the lord of Sablé should stand side by side with the lord
of <abbr title="Sainte-Maure">Ste.-Maure</abbr>. Brachard of Lavardin had a fellow-feeling
with undutiful sons, for he was himself at strife with his
own father, Count John of Vendôme, a faithful ally of
Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>; the same was probably the case of Brachard’s
brother Guy.<a id="Anchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 663.">[663]</a> Bernard of La Ferté represented a family
whose position in their great castle on the Huisne, close to
the Norman border, was almost as independent as that of
their neighbours the lords of Bellême, just across the frontier.
Hugh of Sillé bore a name which in an earlier stage of
Cenomannian history—in the days of the “commune,” just
a hundred years before—had been almost a by-word for
feudal arrogance; and whether or not he inherited anything
of his ancestor’s spirit, he had a personal cause for enmity to
the king if, as is probable, he was akin to a certain Robert
of Sillé, whose share in the southern revolt of 1169 was
punished by Henry, in defiance of treaties, with an imprisonment
so strict and cruel that it was speedily ended
by death.<a id="Anchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 664.">[664]</a></p>

<p>Across the western border of Maine, in Geoffrey’s duchy,
Ralf of Fougères was once more at the head of a band of
discontented Breton nobles, chiefly, it seems, belonging to
that old seed-plot of disturbance, the county of Nantes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">ii.138</a></span><a id="Anchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 665.">[665]</a>
The true centre and focus of revolt, however, was as of old
the duchy of Normandy. Almost all the great names which
have been conspicuous in the earlier risings of the feudal
baronage against the repressive policy of William and of
Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> re-appear among the partizans of the young king.
The house of Montfort on the Rille was represented by that
Robert of Montfort<a id="Anchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 666.">[666]</a> whose challenge to Henry of Essex
ten years before had deprived the king of one of his most
trusty servants. The other and more famous house of Montfort—the
house of Almeric and of Bertrada—was also, now
as ever, in opposition in the person of its head, Count Simon
of Evreux.<a id="Anchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 667.">[667]</a> He, like his fellow-traitor the count of Eu,<a id="Anchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 668.">[668]</a> to
whom, as after-events shewed, may be added the count of
Aumale, represented one of those junior branches of the
Norman ducal house which always resented most bitterly
the determination of the dukes to concentrate all political
power in their own hands. The counts of Ponthieu<a id="Anchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 669.">[669]</a> and of
Alençon<a id="Anchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 670.">[670]</a> inherited the spirit as well as the territories of
Robert of Bellême. Count Robert of Meulan<a id="Anchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 671.">[671]</a> was the son
of Waleran who in 1123 had rebelled against Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>,
and the head of the Norman branch of the great house of
Beaumont, which for more than half a century had stood in
the foremost rank of the baronage on both sides of the sea.
The chief of the English Beaumonts was his cousin and
namesake of Leicester, soon to prove himself an unworthy
son of the faithful justiciar who had died in 1168; while
the countess of Leicester, a woman of a spirit quite as
determined and masculine as her husband’s, was the heiress
of the proud old Norman house of Grandmesnil<a id="Anchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 672.">[672]</a>—a granddaughter
of that Ivo of Grandmesnil who had been banished
by Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> for trying to bring into England the Norman
practice of private warfare. Of the other English rebels,
Hugh of Chester<a id="Anchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 673.">[673]</a> was a son of the fickle Ralf, and had at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">ii.139</a></span>
stake besides his palatine earldom in England his hereditary
viscounties of Bayeux and Avranches on the other side
of the Channel. Hugh Bigod, the aged earl of Norfolk,
untaught by his experiences of feudal anarchy in Stephen’s
day and undeterred by his humiliation in 1157, was ready
to break his faith again for a paltry bribe offered him by the
young king.<a id="Anchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 674.">[674]</a> Earl Robert of Ferrers, Hamo de Massey,
Richard de Morville, and the whole remnant of the great
race of Mowbray—Geoffrey of Coutances, Roger de Mowbray
and his two sons—were all men whose grandfathers
had “come over with the Conqueror,” and determined to
fight to the uttermost for their share in the spoils of the
conquest. All these men were, by training and sympathy,
if not actually by their own personal and territorial interests,
more Norman than English; and the same may probably
be said of the rebels of the second rank, among whom,
beside the purely Norman lords of Anneville and Lessay in
the Cotentin, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Hilaire on the Breton frontier, of Falaise,
Dives, La Haye and Orbec in Calvados, of Tillières, Ivry
and Gaillon along the French border, we find the names of
Ralf of Chesney, Gerald Talbot, Jordan Ridel, Thomas de
Muschamp, Saher de Quincy the younger, Simon of Marsh,
Geoffrey Fitz-Hamon, and Jocelyn Crispin, besides one
which in after-days was to gain far other renown—William
the Marshal.<a id="Anchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 675.">[675]</a></p>

<p>One other rebel there was who stood indeed on a different
footing from all the rest, and whose defection had a
wider political significance. The king of Scots—William
the Lion, brother and successor of Malcolm <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr>—had long
been suspected of a secret alliance with France against his
English cousin and overlord. The younger Henry now
offered him the cession of all Northumberland as far as
the Tyne for himself, and for his brother David confirmation
in the earldom of Huntingdon,<a id="Anchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 676.">[676]</a> with a grant of the earldom
of Cambridge in addition, in return for the homage and
services of both brothers<span class="nobreak">:—</span>offers which the king of Scots
accepted.<a id="Anchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 677.">[677]</a> Only three prelates, on either side of the sea,
shewed any disposition to countenance the rebellion; in
the south, William, the new-made archbishop of Bordeaux;<a id="Anchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 678.">[678]</a>
in the north, Arnulf of Lisieux<a id="Anchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 679.">[679]</a> and Hugh of
Durham. Arnulf’s influence at court had long been on
the wane; all his diplomacy had failed, as far as his personal
interest with King Henry was concerned; but he possessed
the temporal as well as the spiritual lordship of his see;
and the man’s true character now shewed itself at last,
justifying all Henry’s suspicions, in an attempt to play the
part of a great baron rather than of a bishop—to use his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">ii.141</a></span>
diplomatic gifts in temporizing between the two parties,
instead of seeking to make peace between them or to keep
his straying flock in the path of loyalty as a true pastor
should. He did but imitate on a smaller scale and under
less favourable conditions the example set by Hugh of
Puiset in his palatine bishopric of Durham, where he had
been throughout his career simply a great temporal ruler,
whose ecclesiastical character only served to render almost
unassailable the independence of his political position. It
was the pride of the feudal noble, not the personal sympathies
of the churchman, that stirred up both Hugh and
Arnulf to their intrigues against Henry. Personal sympathies
indeed had as yet little share in drawing any of the
barons to the side of the boy-king. What they saw in his
claims was simply a pretext and a watchword which might
serve them to unite against his father. Young Henry himself
evidently relied chiefly on his foreign allies—his father-in-law,
the counts of Flanders and Boulogne, and the count
of Blois, the last of whom was bribed by a promise of an
annual pension and the restitution of Château-Renaud and
Amboise; while to Philip of Flanders was promised the earldom
of Kent with a pension in English gold, and to Matthew
of Boulogne the soke of Kirton-in-Lindsey and the Norman
county of Mortain.<a id="Anchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 680.">[680]</a></p>

<p>The first hostile movement was made directly after Easter
by a body of Flemings who crossed the Seine at Pacy; but
they had no sooner touched Norman soil than they were
driven back by the people of the town, and were nearly all
drowned in attempting to recross the river.<a id="Anchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 681.">[681]</a> Henry meanwhile,
after spending Easter at Alençon,<a id="Anchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 682.">[682]</a> had established his
head-quarters at Rouen, where he remained till the end of
June, apparently indifferent to the plots that were hatching
around him, and entirely absorbed in the pleasures of the
chase.<a id="Anchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 683.">[683]</a> In reality however he was transacting a good deal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">ii.142</a></span>
of quiet business, filling up vacant sees in England;<a id="Anchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 684.">[684]</a> appointing
a new chancellor, Ralf of Varneville, to the office
which had been in commission—that is, virtually, in the
hands of Geoffrey Ridel—ever since <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas had resigned
it ten years before;<a id="Anchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 685.">[685]</a> and writing to all his continental allies
to enlist their sympathies and if possible their support in the
coming struggle.<a id="Anchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 686.">[686]</a> One of them at least, his future son-in-law
William of Sicily, returned an answer full of hearty
sympathy;<a id="Anchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 687.">[687]</a> neither he nor his fellow-kings, however, had
anything more substantial to give. The only support upon
which Henry could really depend was that of a troop of
twenty thousand Brabantine mercenaries, who served him
indeed bravely and loyally, but by no means for nothing;<a id="Anchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 688.">[688]</a>
and if we may trust a writer who, although remote from the
present scene of action, seems to have had a more intimate
acquaintance than most of his fellow-historians with all
matters connected with the Brabantines, Henry’s finances
were already so exhausted that he was obliged to give the
sword of state used at his coronation in pledge to these men
as security for the wages which he was unable to pay them.<a id="Anchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 689.">[689]</a>
Yet he could trust no one else in Normandy; and as yet he
scarcely knew his own resources in England.</p>

<p>Early in June Robert of Leicester and William of Tancarville,
the high-chamberlain of Normandy, sought license<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">ii.143</a></span>
from the justiciars in London to join the king at Rouen.
Immediately on landing, however, they hastened not to
Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, but to his son.<a id="Anchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 690.">[690]</a> The justiciar himself, Richard
de Lucy, was in such anxiety that he seems to have had
some thoughts of going in person to consult with the king.<a id="Anchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 691.">[691]</a>
The consultation however was to be held not in Normandy
but in England. In the last days of June or the first days
of July, while the counts of Flanders and Boulogne were
easily overcoming the mock resistance of Aumale and Driencourt,
and Louis of France was laying siege to Verneuil,<a id="Anchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 692.">[692]</a>
Henry suddenly crossed the sea, made his way as far inland
as Northampton, where he stayed four days, collected his
treasure and his adherents, issued his instructions for action
against the rebels, and was back again at Rouen so quickly
that neither friends nor foes seem ever to have discovered
his absence.<a id="Anchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 693.">[693]</a></p>

    <cite><i>Ibid.</i></cite> On the Southampton entries
Mr. Eyton remarks: “The above charges, from their position on the roll, would
seem to have been incurred after July 15.” But surely if Henry had been in
England during the siege of Leicester, which lasted from July 3 to July 28, we
must have had some mention of his presence; and there is scarcely time for it later,
between the capture of Leicester and his own expedition to Conches on August 7.
Is it not much more natural to conclude that the visit took place earlier—at the
end of June—and that the orders for the Leicester expedition, which
    <cite><abbr title="Roger of Wendover">Rog. Wend.</abbr>
(Coxe, <abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 372)</cite>
expressly says were given by the king, were issued to
Richard de Lucy in a personal interview?
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">ii.144</a></span></p>

<p>Hurried, however, as was the king’s visit to England, it
did its work in bracing up the energies and determining the
action of the vassals who were faithful to him there. In
personal and territorial importance indeed these were very
unequally matched with the rebels. The fidelity of the
Welsh princes, David Ap-Owen and Rees Ap-Griffith,<a id="Anchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 694.">[694]</a> could
not balance the hostility of the King of Scots. Among the
loyal English barons, the most conspicuous were a group of
the king’s immediate kinsmen, none of whom however
ranked high among the descendants of the ducal house of
Normandy<span class="nobreak">:—</span>his half-brother Earl Hameline of Warren, his
uncle Reginald of Cornwall, his cousin William of Gloucester;<a id="Anchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 695.">[695]</a>
besides Earl William of Arundel the husband of his grandfather’s
widow Queen Adeliza, his son William, and his
kinsman Richard of Aubigny. The earl of Essex, William
de Mandeville, was a son of that Geoffrey de Mandeville
who had accepted the earldom of Essex from both Stephen
and Matilda, and who had been one of the worst evil-doers
in the civil war; but the son was as loyal as the father was
faithless; he seems indeed to have been a close personal
friend of the king, and to have well deserved his friendship.<a id="Anchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 696.">[696]</a>
The loyalty of Earl Simon of Northampton may have been
quickened by his rivalry with David of Scotland for the
earldom of Huntingdon. That of William of Salisbury was
an inheritance from his father, Earl Patrick, who had earned
his title by his services to the Empress, and had fallen honourably
at his post of governor of Aquitaine in the rising of
1168. The loyal barons of lesser degree are chiefly representatives
of the class which half a century before had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">ii.145</a></span>
known as the “new men”—men who had risen by virtue of
their services in the work of the administration, either under
Henry himself or under his grandfather. Such were the
justiciar Richard de Lucy and the constable Humfrey de
Bohun; William de Vesci, son of Eustace Fitz-John, and
like his father a mighty man in the north; his nephew John,
constable of Chester;—the whole house of Stuteville, with
Robert de Stuteville the sheriff of Yorkshire at its head;<a id="Anchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 697.">[697]</a>—and
Ralf de Glanville,<a id="Anchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 698.">[698]</a> sheriff of Lancashire, custodian of the
honour of Richmond,<a id="Anchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 699.">[699]</a> and destined in a few years to wider
fame as the worthy successor of Richard de Lucy. The
Glanvilles, the Stutevilles and the de Vescis now wielded in
Yorkshire as the king’s representatives the influence which
had been usurped there by William of Aumale before his
expulsion from Holderness; while in Northumberland a
considerable share of the power formerly exercised by the
rebellious house of Mowbray had passed to servants of the
Crown such as Odelin de Umfraville<a id="Anchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 700.">[700]</a> and Bernard de
Bailleul,<a id="Anchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 701.">[701]</a> whose name in its English form of Balliol became
in after-times closely associated with that borne by two other
loyal northern barons—Robert and Adam de Bruce.<a id="Anchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 702.">[702]</a> To
the same class of “new men” belonged Geoffrey Trussebut,
Everard de Ros, Guy de Vere, Bertram de Verdon, Philip de
Kime and his brother Simon.<a id="Anchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 703.">[703]</a></p>

<p>Three days before the capture of Leicester, an arrow
shot by one of Henry’s Brabantine cross-bowmen gave
Matthew of Boulogne his death-wound, and thereby caused
the break-up of the Flemish expedition against Normandy.<a id="Anchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 717.">[717]</a>
A fortnight later Henry set out at the head of all his
available forces to the relief of Verneuil, which Hugh de
Lacy and Hugh de Beauchamp were defending against the
king of France. By a double treachery Louis, under cover
of a truce, gained possession of the town, set it on fire, and
retreated into his own domains before Henry could overtake
him.<a id="Anchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 718.">[718]</a> Henry marched back to Rouen, taking Gilbert
of Tillières’s castle of Damville on the way,<a id="Anchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 719.">[719]</a> and thence
despatched his Brabantines to check the plundering operations
which Hugh of Chester and Ralf of Fougères were
carrying on unhindered throughout the border district which
lay between Fougères and Avranches. The interception of
an important convoy and the slaughter of its escort by the
Brabantines drove the rebel leaders to retire into the fortress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">ii.148</a></span>
of Dol. Here they were blockaded by the Brabantines,
backed by the populace of the district of Avranches,<a id="Anchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 720.">[720]</a> who
clearly had no sympathy with the treason of their viscount.
The siege began on August 20; on the morrow Henry
received tidings of it at Rouen; on the 23d he appeared in
the midst of his soldiers; and on the 26th Dol and its
garrison, with Ralf of Fougères and Hugh of Chester at
their head, surrendered into his hands.<a id="Anchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 721.">[721]</a> This blow
crushed the Breton revolt; the rest of the duchy submitted
at once.<a id="Anchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 722.">[722]</a> Louis of France was so impressed by
Henry’s success that he began to make overtures for negotiation,
while Henry was holding his court in triumph at Le
Mans. Shortly before Michaelmas a meeting took place
near Gisors; Henry shewed the utmost anxiety to be
reconciled with his sons, offering them literally the half of
his realms in wealth and honours, and declaring his willingness
virtually to strip himself of everything except his
regal powers of government and justice.<a id="Anchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 723.">[723]</a> That, however,
was precisely the reservation against which the French king
and the disaffected barons were both alike determined to
fight as Henry himself had fought against <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas’s
reservation of the rights of his order. The terms were
therefore refused, and the earl of Leicester in his baffled
rage not only loaded his sovereign with abuse, but actually
drew his sword to strike him. This outrage of course broke
up the meeting.<a id="Anchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 724.">[724]</a> Leicester hurried through Flanders, collecting
troops as he went, to Wissant, whence he sailed for
England on Michaelmas day.<a id="Anchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 725.">[725]</a> Landing at Walton in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">ii.149</a></span>
Suffolk, he made his way to Hugh Bigod’s castle of Framlingham;
here the two earls joined their forces; and they
presently took and burned the castle of Haughley, which
Ralf de Broc held against them for the king.<a id="Anchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 726.">[726]</a></p>

<p>At the moment of Leicester’s arrival the representatives
of the king were far away on the Scottish border. At the
close of the summer William of Scotland had gathered his
motley host of Lowland knights and wild Galloway Highlanders,
marched unhindered through the territories of the
see of Durham, and was just beginning to ravage Yorkshire
after the manner of his forefathers when Richard de Lucy
and Humfrey de Bohun hastily reassembled their forces
and marched against him with such promptitude and vigour
that he was compelled to retreat not merely into Lothian
but into the safer shelter of the Celtic Scotland beyond it.
The English host overran Lothian,<a id="Anchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 727.">[727]</a> and had just given
Berwick to the flames when tidings reached them of Earl
Robert’s doings in Suffolk. The king of Scots was
begging for a truce; the English leaders readily consented,
that they might hurry back to their duties in the south.<a id="Anchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 728.">[728]</a>
Richard de Lucy returned to his post of viceroy, and the
supreme military command was left to the constable
Humfrey de Bohun, assisted by the earls of Cornwall and
Gloucester and by Earl William of Arundel,<a id="Anchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 729.">[729]</a> who had now
come to give the help of his sword in England as he had
already given it in Normandy. The constable and the
three earls, with three hundred paid soldiers of the king,
posted themselves at <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s, ready to intercept Earl
Robert on his way from Framlingham to join the garrison<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">ii.150</a></span>
of Leicester.<a id="Anchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 730.">[730]</a> He made a circuit to the northward to
avoid them, but in vain. They marched forth from <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Edmund’s beneath the banner of its patron saint, the famous
East-Anglian king and martyr, overtook the earl in a marsh
near the church of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Geneviève at Fornham,<a id="Anchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 731.">[731]</a> and in spite of
overwhelming odds defeated him completely. His Flemish
mercenaries, who had gone forth in their insolent pride
singing “Hop, hop, Wilekin! England is mine and thine,”<a id="Anchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 732.">[732]</a>
were cut to pieces not so much by the royal troops as by
the peasantry of the district, who flocked to the battle-field
armed with forks and flails, with which they either despatched
them at once or drove them to suffocation in the
ditches.<a id="Anchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 733.">[733]</a> His French and Norman knights were all made
prisoners;<a id="Anchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 734.">[734]</a> he himself took to flight, but was overtaken and
captured;<a id="Anchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 735.">[735]</a> and his wife, who had accompanied him throughout
his enterprise, was made captive with him.<a id="Anchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 736.">[736]</a> The
victors followed up their success by posting bodies of
troops at <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s, Ipswich and Colchester, hoping
that Hugh Bigod, thus confined within his own earldom,
would be unable to provide for the large force of Flemish
mercenaries still quartered in his various castles, and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">ii.151</a></span>
these would be starved into surrender. The approach of
winter however disposed both parties for a compromise; a
truce was arranged to last till the octave of Pentecost,
Hugh consenting to dismiss his Flemings, who were
furnished with a safe-conduct through Essex and Kent and
with ships to transport them from Dover back to their own
land.<a id="Anchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 737.">[737]</a></p>

The number of Robert’s Flemish
troops is surely exaggerated by all these writers; still, even at the lowest computation,
the odds seem to have been, as <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Ralf de Diceto">R. Diceto</abbr> says, at least four to one.

<p>The earl and countess of Leicester were sent over to
Normandy by the king’s orders, there to be shut up in company
with Hugh of Chester in prison at Falaise.<a id="Anchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 738.">[738]</a> Their
capture filled the French king and the rebel princes with
dismay, and none of them dared to venture upon any

The truce made by Richard de Lucy with the king of
Scots was prolonged to the same date—the octave of
Easter—by the diplomacy of Bishop Hugh of Durham,
who took upon himself to purchase this delay, apparently
without authority and for his own private ends, by a
promise of three hundred marks of silver to be paid to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">ii.152</a></span>

of the first countess of Anjou, and is known now as La Haye Descartes—and

<p>The issue proved that Hugh’s real object was simply
to gain time for the organization of a general rising in the
north; and in this object he succeeded. The old isolation
of Yorkshire was not yet a thing of the past; and its few
lines of communication with southern England were now
all blocked, at some point or other, by some stronghold of
rebellion. Earl Hugh’s Chester, Hamo de Massey’s Dunham<a id="Anchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 745.">[745]</a>
and Geoffrey of Coutances’ Stockport commanded the
waters of the Dee and the Mersey. South of the Peak, in the
upper valley of the Trent, the earl of Ferrers held Tutbury
and Duffield; further to south-east, on the opposite border
of Charnwood Forest, lay the earl of Leicester’s capital and
his castles of Groby and Mount Sorrel.<a id="Anchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 746.">[746]</a> By the time that
the truce expired Roger de Mowbray had renewed the
fortifications of Kinardferry in the Isle of Axholm,<a id="Anchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 747.">[747]</a> thus
linking this southern chain of castles with those which he
already possessed at Kirkby Malzeard, or Malessart, and
Thirsk;<a id="Anchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 748.">[748]</a> and Bishop Hugh had done the like at Northallerton.<a id="Anchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 749.">[749]</a>
Further north stood the great stronghold of Durham;
while all these again were backed, far to the north-westward,
by a double belt of fortresses stretching from the
mouths of the Forth and the Tweed to that of the Solway<span class="nobreak">:—</span>Lauder,
held by Richard de Morville; Stirling, Edinburgh,
Berwick, Jedburgh, Roxburgh, Annan and Lochmaben, all
in the hands of the king of Scots.<a id="Anchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 750.">[750]</a></p>

<p>Between this northern belt of rebel strongholds, however,
and the southern one which stretched from Chester to
Axholm, there lay along the river-valleys of Cumberland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">ii.153</a></span>
and Northumberland a cluster of royal castles. Nicolas de
Stuteville held Liddell, on the river of the same name.
Burgh<a id="Anchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 751.">[751]</a> stood on the Solway Firth, nearly opposite Annan;
the whole valley of the Eden was guarded by Carlisle,
whose castellan was Richard de Vaux,<a id="Anchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 752.">[752]</a> and Appleby, which
like Burgh was held by Robert de Stuteville for the king.<a id="Anchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 753.">[753]</a>
The course of the Tyne was commanded by Wark, under
Roger de Stuteville,<a id="Anchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 754.">[754]</a> Prudhoe, under Odelin de Umfraville,<a id="Anchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 755.">[755]</a>
and by the great royal fortress of Newcastle, in charge of
Roger Fitz-Richard;<a id="Anchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 756.">[756]</a> further north, between the valleys of
the Wansbeck and the Coquet, stood Harbottle, also held by
Odelin, with Roger Fitz-Richard’s Warkworth<a id="Anchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 757.">[757]</a> and William
de Vesci’s Alnwick<a id="Anchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 758.">[758]</a> at the mouths of the Coquet and the
Alne. This chain of defences William of Scotland, when
at the expiration of the truce he again marched into England,
at once set himself to break. While his brother David
went to join the rebel garrison of Leicester,<a id="Anchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 759.">[759]</a> he himself
began by laying siege to Wark. This fortress, held in the
king’s name by Roger de Stuteville—apparently a brother
of the sheriff of Yorkshire—occupied a strong position in
the upper valley of the Tyne, on the site of an earlier
fortress which under the name of Carham had played a
considerable part in the Scottish wars of Stephen’s time,
and had been finally taken and razed by William’s grandfather
King David in 1138.<a id="Anchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 760.">[760]</a> William himself had already
in the preceding autumn besieged Wark without success;<a id="Anchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 761.">[761]</a>
he prospered no better this time, and presently removed his
forces to Carlisle,<a id="Anchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 762.">[762]</a> where he had also sustained a like repulse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">ii.154</a></span>
six months before.<a id="Anchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 763.">[763]</a> Carlisle, as well as Wark, was in truth
almost impregnable except by starvation; and William,
while blockading it closely, detached a part of his host for
a series of expeditions against the lesser fortresses, Liddell,
Burgh, Appleby, Harbottle and Warkworth, all of which fell
into his hands.<a id="Anchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 764.">[764]</a> His brother’s arrival at Leicester, meanwhile,
seemed to have revived the energies of its garrison; under
the command of Earl Robert of Ferrers they sallied forth
very early one morning, surprised and burned the town of
Nottingham, made a great slaughter of its citizens, and went
home laden with plunder and prisoners.<a id="Anchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 765.">[765]</a></p>

Nottingham was commanded by Reginald de Lucy; what relation to the justiciar?
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile the king’s representatives in the south were
not idle. Knowing however that he was powerless to rescue
the north, Richard de Lucy made an attempt to draw off in
another direction the forces both of the Scot king and of his
brother by laying siege to David’s castle of Huntingdon.<a id="Anchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 766.">[766]</a>
Huntingdon had been held ever since 1136 either by the
reigning king of Scots or by one of his nearest kinsmen, in
virtue of their descent from Waltheof, the last Old-English
earl of Huntingdon and Northampton, through his daughter
Matilda, the wife of King David. In each case, however,
the fief seems to have been held not as an hereditary possession
but by a special grant made to the individual holder for
his life. The house of Northampton, sprung from an earlier
marriage of the same Matilda, were thus enabled to maintain
a claim upon it which had never been entirely barred,
and which Earl Simon of Northampton now seized his
opportunity to urge upon the king.<a id="Anchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 767.">[767]</a> Henry answered that
Simon might keep Huntingdon if he could win it;<a id="Anchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 768.">[768]</a> thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">ii.155</a></span>
securing for Richard de Lucy his support and co-operation
in the siege, which began on May 8.<a id="Anchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 769.">[769]</a> Three days before
this, however, a severe blow had been dealt at the northern
rebels. The king’s eldest son Geoffrey, who a year before
had been appointed to the bishopric of Lincoln, gathered up
the forces of Lincolnshire, led them into Axholm and laid
siege to Kinardferry. Robert of Mowbray, who was commanding
there, seeing his garrison threatened with
the want of water, slipped out to seek aid of his friends at
Leicester, but was surrounded and made prisoner by the
country-folk at Clay.<a id="Anchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 770.">[770]</a> On May 5 Kinardferry surrendered;
after razing it, Geoffrey marched northward to York;
here he was joined by the forces of the archbishop and of
the shire; with this united host he took Mowbray’s castle of
Malessart,<a id="Anchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 771.">[771]</a> closely menaced that of Thirsk by erecting a rival
fortification at Topcliff, and having intrusted the former to
Archbishop Roger and the latter to William de Stuteville,
marched back to Lincoln in triumph.<a id="Anchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 772.">[772]</a> His victory was
scarcely won when a new peril arose in East-Anglia. Three
days after Pentecost some three hundred Flemish soldiers,
forerunners of a great host with which Count Philip of
Flanders had sworn to invade England at Midsummer on
behalf of the young king, landed at the mouth of the Orwell.<a id="Anchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 773.">[773]</a>
Hugh Bigod, whose truce with the king’s officers, made when
he dismissed his other Flemish troops in the preceding
autumn, expired four days later, at once received them into
his castles.<a id="Anchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 774.">[774]</a> For a whole month, however, no further movement
was made save by the garrison of Leicester, who after
the close of Whitsun-week made a successful plundering raid
upon the town of Northampton.<a id="Anchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 775.">[775]</a> On June 18 Hugh
Bigod and his Flemings marched upon Norwich, took it by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">ii.156</a></span>
assault, committed a vast slaughter of men and women, and
finally sacked and fired the city.<a id="Anchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 776.">[776]</a> They seem to have returned
to Framlingham by way of Dunwich, which was still
a flourishing seaport, of sufficient wealth to tempt their
greed; but its stout fisher-folk met them with such a determined
front that they were compelled to retire.<a id="Anchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 777.">[777]</a></p>

<p>Richard de Lucy was all this while busy with the siege
of Huntingdon. Provoked apparently by a vigorous assault
which he made upon it at midsummer,<a id="Anchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 778.">[778]</a> the garrison set fire
to the town; Richard then built a tower to block their
egress from the castle, and left the completion of the siege
to the earl of Northampton.<a id="Anchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 779.">[779]</a> For himself it was time once
more to lay down the knightly sword and resume that of
justice. While the justiciar’s energies were absorbed in warfare
with the barons, the burgher-nobles of the capital had
caught from their feudal brethren the spirit of lawlessness
and misrule, and London had become a vast den of thieves
and murderers. Young men, sons and kinsmen of the
noblest citizens, habitually went forth by night in parties of
a hundred or more, broke into rich men’s houses and robbed
them by force, and if they met any man walking in the
streets alone, slew him at once. Peaceable citizens were
driven in self-defence to meet violence with violence. One
man, expecting an attack, gathered his armed servants
around him in a concealed corner, surprised his assailants
in the act of breaking into his house with crowbars, struck
off with a blow of his sword the right hand of their leader<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">ii.157</a></span>
Andrew Bucquinte, and raised an alarm which put the rest
to flight. Bucquinte was captured and delivered next
morning to the justiciar; on a promise of safety for life
and limb he gave up the names of his accomplices; some
fled, some were caught, and among the latter was one of the
noblest and richest citizens of London, John Oldman,<a id="Anchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 780.">[780]</a> who
vainly offered five hundred marks of silver to the Crown to
purchase his escape from the gallows.<a id="Anchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 781.">[781]</a> The revelation of
such a state of things in the capital apparently drove
Richard de Lucy and his colleagues almost to desperation.
They had already sent messenger after messenger to intreat
that the king would return; getting however no certain
answer, they now determined that one of their number
should go to Normandy in person to lay before him an
authentic account of the desperate condition of his realm.<a id="Anchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 782.">[782]</a></p>

The story is there told in connexion
with that of the murder of a brother of the earl of Ferrers in 1177, and
said to have happened “three years before.” The wording of the latter part,
where it is said that John “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">obtulit quingentas marcas argenti <i>domino regi</i> <span class="dots">...</span>

Bucquinte and the execution of John. In that case the date of the affair would
be about June or July 1174.

<p>Henry had spent the spring in a successful progress
through Maine and Anjou to Poitiers, where he kept the
Whitsun feast. He had just rescued Saintes from a band
of rebels who had seized it in Richard’s name<a id="Anchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 783.">[783]</a> when he
was called northward again by a rumour of the Flemish
count’s scheme for the invasion of England. By <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Barnabas’s
day he was back again on the borders of Britanny and
Anjou; he took and fortified Ancenis, and then, leaving
Anjou to the charge of a faithful baron, Maurice of Craon,<a id="Anchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 784.">[784]</a>
went to meet the castellans of the Norman border in a
council at Bonneville on Midsummer-day. Their deliberations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">ii.158</a></span>
were interrupted by the appearance of Richard of
Ilchester—now bishop-elect of Winchester—on his errand
from England to recall the king.<a id="Anchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 785.">[785]</a> Richard’s pleadings however
were scarcely needed. Henry knew that his eldest son
was at that very moment with the count of Flanders at
Gravelines, only awaiting a favourable wind to set sail for
the invasion of England,<a id="Anchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 786.">[786]</a> and that, whatever might be the
risk to his continental realms, he must hasten to save the
island.<a id="Anchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 787.">[787]</a> He at once took measures for the security of the
Norman castles and for the transport of those prisoners and
suspected persons whom he dared not venture to leave behind
him—his queen,<a id="Anchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 788.">[788]</a> the earl and countess of Leicester,
the earl of Chester,<a id="Anchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 789.">[789]</a> the young queen Margaret,<a id="Anchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 790.">[790]</a> and the
affianced brides of his three younger sons; besides the two
children who were still with him, Jane and John.<a id="Anchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 791.">[791]</a> The
wind which thwarted the designs of his foes was equally
unfavourable to him; it was not till July 7 that he himself
embarked at Barfleur, and even then the peril of crossing
seemed so great that the sailors were inclined to put
back. Henry raised his eyes to heaven: “If I seek the
peace of my realm—if the heavenly King wills that my
return should restore its peace—He will bring me safe into
port. If He has turned away His Face from me and
determined to scourge my realm, may I never reach its
shores!” By nightfall he was safe<a id="Anchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 792.">[792]</a> at Southampton.<a id="Anchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 793.">[793]</a></p>

<p>His first care was to bestow his prisoners and hostages
in safe custody.<a id="Anchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 794.">[794]</a> That done, he set off at once on a pilgrimage
to the grave of his former friend and victim at
Canterbury. Travelling with the utmost speed, and feeding
only on bread and water, he reached Canterbury on July
12; before the church of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Dunstan, outside the west
gate, he dismounted, exchanged his kingly robes for the
woollen gown of a pilgrim, and made his way with bare
and bleeding feet along the rough-paved streets to the
cathedral church. Here, surrounded by a group of bishops
and abbots who seem to have come with him, as well as by
the monks of the cathedral chapter and a crowd of wondering
lay-folk, he threw himself in an agony of penitence
and prayer on the martyr’s tomb, which still stood in the
crypt where his body had been hastily buried by the terrified
monks immediately after the murder. The bishop of London
now came forward and spoke in the king’s name, solemnly
protesting that he had never sought the primate’s death, and
beseeching absolution from the assembled prelates for the
rash words which had occasioned it. The absolution was
given; the king then underwent a public scourging at the
hands of the bishops and monks; he spent the whole night
in prayer before the shrine; early on the morrow he heard
mass and departed, leaving rich gifts in money and endowments,
and rode back still fasting to London, which he
reached on the following morning.<a id="Anchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 795.">[795]</a> The next few days were
spent in collecting forces, in addition to a large troop of
Brabantines whom he had brought over with him,<a id="Anchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 796.">[796]</a> and in

<p>In the middle of the night of July 17 a courier from
the north came knocking wildly for admittance at the palace-gate.
The porters remonstrated with him in vain; he bore,
he said, good news which the king must hear that very
night. He hurried to the door of the king’s chamber, and,
despite the expostulations of the chamberlains, made his way
to the bedside and woke the king from his sleep. “Who
art thou?” demanded Henry. “A servant of your faithful
Ralf de Glanville, and the bearer of good tidings from him
to you.” “Is he well?” “He is well; and lo! he holds
your enemy the king of Scots in chains at Richmond castle.”
Not till he had seen Ralf’s own letters could Henry believe
the tidings; then he burst into thanksgivings for the crowning
triumph which had come to him, as he now learned, almost
at the moment when his voluntary humiliation at Canterbury
was completed.<a id="Anchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 798.">[798]</a> The garrison of Carlisle had pledged
themselves to surrender to the Scot king at Michaelmas if
not previously relieved. In the interval William laid siege
to Odelin de Umfraville’s castle of Prudhoe on the Tyne.<a id="Anchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 799.">[799]</a>
Here he was rejoined by Roger de Mowbray, who
came to intreat
the Scot king’s aid in the recovery of his lost castles.<a id="Anchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 800.">[800]</a> Meanwhile,
however, the king’s return had apparently brought
with it the return of the sheriff of Yorkshire, Robert de
Stuteville. Under his leadership and that of his son William
the whole military forces of the shire, with those of William
de Vesci, Ralf de Glanville, Bernard de Balliol and Odelin
de Umfraville, and Archbishop Roger’s men under his constable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">ii.161</a></span>
Ralf de Tilly, gathered and marched northward to
oppose the Scots.<a id="Anchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 801.">[801]</a> They reached Newcastle on July 12<a id="Anchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 802.">[802]</a>—the
day of Henry’s penitential entry into Canterbury—but
only to find that on the rumour of their approach William
the Lion had retired from Prudhoe, and was gone to besiege
Alnwick with his own picked followers, while the bulk of
his host, under the earls of Fife and Angus and the English
traitor Richard de Morville, dispersed over all Northumberland
to burn, plunder and slay in the old barbarous Scottish
fashion which seems hardly to have softened since the days
of Malcolm Canmore.<a id="Anchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 803.">[803]</a> The English leaders now held a
council of war. Their forces consisted only of a few hundred
knights, all wearied and spent with their long and
hurried march, in which the foot had been unable to keep
up with them at all. The more cautious argued that enough
had been done in driving back the Scots thus far, and that
it would be madness for a band of four hundred men to
advance against a host of eighty thousand. Bolder spirits,
however, urged that the justice of their cause must suffice to
prevail against any odds; and it was decided to continue
the march to Alnwick. They set out next morning before
sunrise; the further they rode, the thicker grew the mist;
some proposed to turn back. “Turn back who will,” cried
Bernard de Balliol, “if no man will follow me, I will go on
alone, rather than bear the stain of cowardice for ever!”
Every one of them followed him; and when at last the mist
cleared away, the first sight that met their eyes was the
friendly castle of Alnwick. Close beside it lay the king of
Scots, carelessly playing with a little band of some sixty
knights. Never dreaming that the English host would dare
to pursue him thus far, he had sent out all the rest of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">ii.162</a></span>
troops on a plundering expedition, and at the first appearance
of the enemy he took them for his own followers returning
with their spoils. When they unfurled their banners he saw
at once that his fate was sealed. The Scottish Lion, however,
proved worthy of his name, and his followers proved
worthy of their leader. Seizing his arms and shouting,
“Now it shall be seen who are true knights!” he rushed
upon the English; his horse was killed, he himself was
surrounded and made prisoner, and so were all his men.<a id="Anchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 804.">[804]</a>
Roger de Mowbray and Adam de Port, an English baron
who had been outlawed two years before for an attempt on
King Henry’s life, alone fled away into Scotland;<a id="Anchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 805.">[805]</a> not one
Scot tried to escape, and some even who were not on the
spot, when they heard the noise of the fray, rode hastily
up and almost forced themselves into the hands of their
captors, deeming it a knightly duty to share their sovereign’s
fate.<a id="Anchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 806.">[806]</a></p>

<p>The capture of William the Lion almost put an end to
the rebellion. A body of Flemings summoned by Bishop
Hugh of Durham landed the same day at Hartlepool; but
at the tidings of the Scottish disaster, Hugh thought it safest
to pay them their forty days’ wages and send them home
again at once.<a id="Anchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 807.">[807]</a> On the same day, too, the young king,
weary of waiting for a wind at Gravelines, left the count of
Flanders there alone and proceeded to Wissant with a body
of troops whom he succeeded in despatching from thence
into England, under the command of Ralf of La Haye, to the
assistance of Hugh Bigod.<a id="Anchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 808.">[808]</a> In London, meanwhile, the news
brought by Ralf de Glanville’s courier raised to the highest
pitch the spirits both of Henry and of his troops. On that
very day he set out for Huntingdon,<a id="Anchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 809.">[809]</a> whose titular earl had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">ii.163</a></span>
already fled back to Scotland;<a id="Anchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 810.">[810]</a> at Huntingdon Geoffrey of
Lincoln came to meet him with a force of seven hundred
knights;<a id="Anchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 811.">[811]</a> and three days later the garrison surrendered at
discretion.<a id="Anchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 812.">[812]</a> The king then marched to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s; here
he divided his host, sending half against Hugh Bigod’s castle
of Bungay, while he himself led the other half to Framlingham,
where Hugh was entrenched with five hundred knights
and his Flemish men-at-arms. The number of these, however,
had dwindled greatly; when the royal host encamped
on July 24 at Sileham, close to Framlingham, Hugh felt
himself unable to cope with it; and next morning he
surrendered.<a id="Anchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 813.">[813]</a> By the end of the month the whole struggle
was over. One by one the king’s foes came to his feet as
he held his court at Northampton. The king of Scots was
brought, with his feet tied together under his horse’s body,
from his prison<a id="Anchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 814.">[814]</a> at Richmond.<a id="Anchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 815.">[815]</a> On the last day of July
Bishop Hugh of Durham came to give up his castles of
Durham, Norham and Northallerton. On the same day the
earl of Leicester’s three fortresses were surrendered by his
constables;<a id="Anchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 816.">[816]</a> and Thirsk was given up by Roger of Mowbray.<a id="Anchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 817.">[817]</a>
Earl Robert de Ferrers yielded up Tutbury and Duffield;<a id="Anchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 818.">[818]</a>
the earl of Gloucester and his son-in-law Richard de Clare,
who were suspected of intriguing with the rebels, came to
offer their services and their obedience to the king;<a id="Anchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 819.">[819]</a> and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">ii.164</a></span>
like offer came from far-off Galloway, whose native princes,
Uhtred and Gilbert, long unwilling vassals of the king of
Scots, had seized their opportunity to call home their men,
drive out William’s bailiffs, destroy his castles and slaughter
his garrisons, and now besought his victorious English cousin
to become their protector and overlord.<a id="Anchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 820.">[820]</a> In three weeks
from Henry’s landing in England all the royal fortresses
were again in his hands, and the country was once more at
peace.<a id="Anchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 821.">[821]</a></p>

a summons to surrender; whereupon David gave up Leicester castle and himself

<p>When England was secured, it was comparatively a light
matter to secure the rest. Louis of France was so dismayed
at the sudden collapse of the rebellion in England—a collapse
which necessarily entailed a like fate upon the rebellion in
Normandy, since the leaders were the same men in both
cases—that he at once recalled the young king and the
count of Flanders from their project of invasion. As a last
resource, all three concentrated their forces upon the siege of
Rouen.<a id="Anchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 822.">[822]</a> Its garrison held out gallantly until Henry had
time to recross the sea with his Brabantines and a thousand
Welshmen<a id="Anchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 823.">[823]</a> who had already done good service under Rees
Ap-Griffith at the siege of Tutbury.<a id="Anchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 824.">[824]</a> On August 11, three
days after landing, he entered Rouen;<a id="Anchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 825.">[825]</a> a successful raid of
his Welshmen upon some French convoys, followed by an
equally successful sally of Henry himself against the besieging
forces, sufficed to make Louis ask for a truce, under cover
of which he fled with his whole host back into his own
dominions.<a id="Anchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 826.">[826]</a> Some three weeks later<a id="Anchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 827.">[827]</a> he and Henry met in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">ii.165</a></span>
conference at Gisors and arranged a suspension of hostilities

his son Richard, who was fighting independently against his
father’s loyal subjects in Poitou.<a id="Anchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 828.">[828]</a> Henry marched southward
at once; Richard fled before him from place to place, leaving
his conquests to fall back one by one into the hands of
their rightful owner; at last he suddenly returned to throw
himself at his father’s feet, and a few days before Michaelmas
Henry concluded his war in Poitou<a id="Anchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 829.">[829]</a> by entering Poitiers in
triumph with Richard, penitent and forgiven, at his side.<a id="Anchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 830.">[830]</a></p>

<p>On the last day of September the two kings and all the
princes met in conference between Tours and Amboise.<a id="Anchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 831.">[831]</a>
Henry’s three elder sons accepted the endowments which he
offered them; in return, the young king gave his assent to a
provision for John. A general amnesty was agreed upon;
all prisoners on both sides, except the king of Scots, the
earls of Leicester and Chester and Ralf of Fougères, were
released at once; all the rebels returned to their allegiance,
and were fully forgiven; Henry claimed nothing from any
of them save the restoration of their castles to the condition
in which they had been before the war, and the right of
taking such hostages and other security as he might choose.<a id="Anchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 832.">[832]</a>
These terms of course did not apply to England; while, on
the other hand, the king of Scots and his fellow-captives,
whom Henry had brought back with him to Normandy and
replaced in confinement at Falaise,<a id="Anchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 833.">[833]</a> were excluded from them
as prisoners of war. It was at Falaise, on October 11, that
Henry and his sons embodied their agreement in a written
document.<a id="Anchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 834.">[834]</a> A few weeks later William of Scotland, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">ii.166</a></span>
the formal assent of the bishops and barons of his realm,
who had been allowed free access to him during his captivity,
submitted to pay the price which Henry demanded for his
ransom. The legal relations between the crowns of England
and Scotland had been doubtful ever since the days of
William the Conqueror and Malcolm Canmore, if not since
the days of Eadward the Elder and Constantine; henceforth
they were to be doubtful no longer. William the Lion
became the liegeman of the English king and of his son for
Scotland and for all his other lands, and agreed that their
heirs should be entitled to a like homage and fealty from all
future kings of Scots. The castles of Roxburgh, Jedburgh,
Berwick, Edinburgh and Stirling were required by Henry as
security; and as soon as the treaty had been ratified at
Valognes<a id="Anchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 835.">[835]</a> William was sent over sea in a sort of honourable
custody to enforce their surrender and thereby complete his
own release.<a id="Anchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 836.">[836]</a></p>

<p>By the terms of Henry’s treaty with France, all the
English barons who held lands on both sides of the sea were
to be at once re-instated in their continental possessions,
except the castles over which the king resumed his ancient
rights of garrison or of demolition. Their English estates
however were wholly at his mercy; but he made a very
gentle use of his power over them. He took in fact no
personal vengeance at all; he exacted simply what was
necessary for securing his own authority and the peace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">ii.167</a></span>
of the realm—the instant departure of the Flemish mercenaries<a id="Anchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 837.">[837]</a>
and the demolition of unlicensed fortifications—and
for defraying the expenses of the war. This was done by a
tax levied partly on the royal demesnes, partly on the estates
of the rebels throughout the country, on the basis of an
assessment made for that purpose during the past summer
by the sheriffs of the several counties, assisted by some
officers of the Exchequer.<a id="Anchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 838.">[838]</a> No ruinous sums were demanded;
even Hugh Bigod escaped with a fine of a thousand marks,
and lost none of the revenues of his earldom save for the
time that he was actually in open rebellion; the third penny
of Norfolk was reckoned as due to him again from the third
day after his surrender, and its amount for two months was
paid to him accordingly at Michaelmas.<a id="Anchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 839.">[839]</a> Even the earls of
Leicester and Chester seem to have been at once set free;<a id="Anchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 840.">[840]</a>
and in little more than two years they were restored to all
their lands and honours, except their castles, which were
either razed or retained in the king’s hands.<a id="Anchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 841.">[841]</a></p>

<p>This very clemency was in itself at once the strongest
proof of the completeness of Henry’s victory and the surest
means of retaining the hold which he had now gained over
the barons. The struggle whose course we have been trying
to follow has a special significance: it was the last struggle
in English history in which the barons were arrayed against
the united interests of the Crown and the people. That
feudal pride which had revolted so often and so fiercely
against the determination of William the Conqueror and
Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> to enforce justice and order throughout their realm
stooped at last to acknowledge its master in Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">ii.168</a></span>
In the unbroken tranquillity, the uninterrupted developement
of reform in law and administration, the unchecked growth
of the material and social prosperity of England during the
remaining fifteen years of his reign, Henry and his people
reaped the first-fruits of the anti-feudal policy which he and his
predecessors had so long and so steadily maintained. Its
full harvest was to be reaped after he was gone, not by the
sovereign, but by the barons themselves, to whom his strong
hand had at last taught their true mission as leaders
and champions of the English people against a king who
had fallen away from the traditions alike of the Norman
and of the Angevin Henry.</p>

<span class="ch3">1175–1183.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the seven years which followed the suppression of the
barons’ revolt Henry’s prosperity reached its height. The
rising in which all his enemies had united for his destruction
had ended in leaving him seated more firmly than ever upon
the most securely-established throne in Europe. Within the
four seas of Britain he was master as no king had ever been
master before him. The English people had been with him
from the first, and was learning year by year to identify its
interests more closely with his; the Church, alienated for
nearly ten years, was reconciled by his penance; feudalism
was beaten at last, and for ever. The Welsh princes were
his obedient and serviceable vassals; the Scot king had been
humbled to accept a like position; a new subject-realm was
growing up on the coast of Ireland. The great external
peril which had dogged Henry’s footsteps through life, the
hostility of France, was for a while paralyzed by his success.
Other external foes he had none; the kings of Spain and
of Sicily, the princes of the Western and even of the Eastern
Empire, vied with each other in seeking the friendship, one
might almost say the patronage, of the one sovereign in
Europe who, safe on his sea-girt throne, could afford to be
independent of them all. Within and without, on either side
of the sea, all hindrances to the full and free developement
of Henry’s policy for the government of his whole dominions
were thus completely removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">ii.170</a></span></p>

<p>In England itself the succeeding period was one of
unbroken tranquillity and steady prosperous growth, social,
intellectual, political, constitutional. Henry used his opportunity
to make a longer stay in the island than he had
ever made there before, save at the very beginning of his
reign. He was there from May 1175 to August 1177; in
the following July he returned, and stayed till April 1180;
he came back again in July 1181, and remained till March
1182. Each of these visits was marked by some further
step towards the completion of his judicial and administrative
reforms. Almost as soon as he set foot in the country,
indeed, he took up his work as if it had never been interrupted.
The king and his eldest son went to England
together on May 9, 1175;<a id="Anchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 842.">[842]</a> on Rogation Sunday they
publicly sealed their reconciliation with each other and with
the Church in a great council which met at Westminster<a id="Anchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 843.">[843]</a>
under the presidence of a new archbishop of Canterbury,
Richard, formerly prior of Dover, who after countless troubles
and delays had been chosen just before the outbreak of the
rebellion to fill <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas’s place,<a id="Anchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 844.">[844]</a> and had come back from
Rome in triumph, with his pallium and a commission as

before, of filling up the vacant bishoprics and abbacies
which had been accumulating during Thomas’s exile was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">ii.171</a></span>
completed in another council at Woodstock.<a id="Anchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 849.">[849]</a> Thence, too,
was issued an edict for the better securing of order throughout
the realm, and particularly around the person of the
king; all his opponents in the late war were forbidden, on
pain of arrest as traitors, to come to the court without special
summons, and, under any circumstances, to come before sunrise
or stay over night; and all wearing of arms, knife, bow
and arrows, was forbidden on the English side of the Severn.
These prohibitions however were only temporary;<a id="Anchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 850.">[850]</a> and they
were, with one exception, the only measure of general
severity taken by Henry in consequence of the rebellion.
That exception was a great forest-visitation, begun by
Henry in person during the summer of 1175 and not
completed by his ministers, it seems, till Michaelmas 1177,
and from which scarcely a man throughout the kingdom,
baron or villein, layman or priest, was altogether exempt.
In vain did Richard de Lucy, as loyal to the people as to
the king, shew Henry his own royal writ authorizing the
justiciars to throw open the forests and give up the royal
fish-ponds to public use during the war, and protest against
the injustice of punishing the people at large for a trespass
to which he had himself invited them in the king’s name and
in accordance, as he had understood it, with the king’s expressed
will. The license had probably been used to a far
wider extent than Henry had intended; the general excitement
had perhaps vented itself in some such outburst of
wanton destructiveness as had occurred after the death of
Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>; at any rate, the Norman and the Angevin blood
in Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> was all alike stirred into wrath at sight of
damage done to vert and venison; the transgressors were
placed, in technical phrase, “at the king’s mercy,” and their
fines constituted an important item in the Pipe Roll of
1176.<a id="Anchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 851.">[851]</a></p>

<p>In the beginning of that year the king assembled a great
council at Northampton,<a id="Anchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 852.">[852]</a> and thence issued an Assize which
forms another link in the series of legal enactments begun
at Clarendon just ten years before. The first three clauses
and the twelfth clause of the Assize of Northampton are
substantially a re-issue of those articles of the Assize of
Clarendon which regulated the presentment, detention and
punishment of criminals and the treatment of strangers and
vagabonds.<a id="Anchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 853.">[853]</a> The experience of the past ten years had
however led to some modifications in the details of the procedure.
The recognition by twelve lawful men of every
hundred and four of every township, to be followed by
ordeal of water, was re-enacted; but the presentment was
now to be made not to the sheriff, but direct to the king’s
justices. The punishments, too, were more severe than
before; the forger, robber, murderer or incendiary who
under the former system would have suffered the loss of a
foot was now to lose a hand as well, and to quit the realm
within forty days.<a id="Anchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 854.">[854]</a> The remaining articles dealt with quite
other matters. The fourth declared the legal order of proceeding
with regard to the estate of a deceased freeholder, in
such a manner as to secure the rights of his heir and of his
widow before the usual relief could be exacted by the lord;
and it referred all disputes between the lord and the heir
touching the latter’s right of inheritance to the decision of
the king’s justices, on the recognition of twelve lawful men<a id="Anchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 855.">[855]</a>—a
process which, under the name of the assize of <i>mort
d’ancester</i>, soon became a regular part of the business transacted
before the justices-in-eyre. Some of the other clauses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">ii.173</a></span>
had a more political significance. They directed the justices
to take an oath of homage and fealty to the king from every
man in the realm, earl, baron, knight, freeholder or villein,
before the octave of Whit-Sunday at latest, and to arrest as
traitors all who refused it:<a id="Anchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 856.">[856]</a>—to investigate and strictly
enforce the demolition of the condemned castles;<a id="Anchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 857.">[857]</a> to ascertain
and report by whom, how and where the duty of castle-guard
was owed to the king;<a id="Anchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 858.">[858]</a> to inquire what persons had
fled from justice and incurred the penalty of outlawry by
failing to give themselves up at the appointed time, and to
send in a list of all such persons to the Exchequer at Easter
and Michaelmas for transmission to the king.<a id="Anchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 859.">[859]</a> The tenth
article was aimed at the bailiffs of the royal demesnes,
requiring them to give an account of their stewardship
before the Exchequer;<a id="Anchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 860.">[860]</a> and two others defined the justices’
authority, as extending, in judicial matters, over all pleas of
the Crown, both in criminal causes and in civil actions concerning
half a knight’s fee or less; and in fiscal matters,
over escheats, wardships, and lands and churches in royal
demesne.<a id="Anchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 861.">[861]</a></p>

<p>The visitations of the justices by whom this assize was
carried into effect were arranged upon a new plan, or rather
upon a modified form of the plan which had been adopted
two years before for the assessment of a tallage upon the royal
demesnes, to meet the cost of the expected war. It was at
that terrible crisis, when most men in Henry’s place would
have had no thought to spare for anything save the military
necessities and perils of the moment, that he had first
devised and carried into effect the principle of judicial
circuits which with some slight changes in detail has remained
in force until our own day. This tallage was levied
by nineteen barons of the Exchequer, distributed into six
companies, each company undertaking the assessment
throughout a certain district or group of shires.<a id="Anchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 862.">[862]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">ii.174</a></span>
abandonment of this scheme in the assizes of the two
following years was probably necessitated by the disturbed
state of the country. But at the council of Northampton
the kingdom was again definitely mapped out into six divisions,
to each of which three justices were sent.<a id="Anchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 863.">[863]</a> In the

officially described by the title which they had long borne
in common speech, “<i>justitiæ itinerantes</i>” (or “<i>errantes</i>”),
justices-in-eyre; and it is from this time that the regular
institution of itinerant judges is dated by modern legal
historians.<a id="Anchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 865.">[865]</a></p>

<p>This first distribution of circuits however was soon
altered. In the very next year the same eighteen officers
made, in addition to their judicial circuits, a general visitation
of the realm for fiscal purposes, in four companies
instead of six;<a id="Anchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 866.">[866]</a> and on Henry’s return to England in the
summer of 1178 he made what at first glance looks like a
sweeping change in the organization of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia Regis</span>.
“The king,” we are told, “made inquiry concerning his
justices whom he had appointed in England, whether they
treated the men of the realm with righteousness and moderation;
and when he learned that the country and the people
were sore oppressed by the great multitude of justices—for
they were eighteen in number—by the counsel of the wise
men of the realm he chose out five, two clerks and three
laymen, who were all of his private household; and he
decreed that those five should hear all the complaints of
the realm, and do right, and that they should not depart
from the king’s court, but abide there to hear the complaints
of his men; so that if any question came up among them
which they could not bring to an end, it should be presented
to the king’s hearing and determined as might please him
and the wise men of the realm.”<a id="Anchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 867.">[867]</a> From the mention of the
number eighteen it appears that the persons against whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">ii.175</a></span>
were primarily directed both the complaint of the people
and the action of the king were the justices-in-eyre of the
last two years; and this is confirmed by the fact that of all
these eighteen, only six were among the judges who went
on circuit in 1178 and 1179, while from 1180 onwards
only one of them reappears in that capacity, though many
of them retained their functions in the Exchequer. In
1178 and 1179 moreover the circuits were reduced from
six to two, each being served by four judges.<a id="Anchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 868.">[868]</a> The enactment
of 1178, however, evidently touched the central as
well as the provincial judicature, and with more important
results. It took the exercise of the highest judicial functions
out of the hands of the large body of officers who made up
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia Regis</span> as constituted until that time, and restricted
it to a small chosen committee. This was apparently
the origin of a limited tribunal which, springing up thus
within the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia Regis</span>, soon afterwards appropriated its
name, and in later days grew into the Court of King’s
Bench. At the same time the reservation of difficult
cases for the hearing of the king in council points to the
creation, or rather to the revival, of a yet higher court of
justice, that of the king himself in council with his “wise
men”—a phrase which, while on the one hand it carries
us back to the very earliest form of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia Regis</span>,
on the other points onward to its later developements
in the modern tribunals of equity or of appeal, the
courts of Chancery and of the Privy Council in its judicial
capacity.<a id="Anchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 869.">[869]</a></p>

<p>All these changes in the circuits and in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia Regis</span>
had however another motive. The chief obstacle to Henry’s
judicial and legal reforms was the difficulty of getting them
administered according to the intention of their author. It
was to meet this difficulty that Henry, as a contemporary
writer says, “while never changing his mind, was ever
changing his ministers.”<a id="Anchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 870.">[870]</a> He had employed men chosen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">ii.176</a></span>
from every available class of society in turn, and none of
his experiments had altogether brought him satisfaction.
Feudal nobles, court officials, confidential servants and
friends, had all alike been tried and, sooner or later, found
wanting.<a id="Anchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 871.">[871]</a> There was only one who had never yet failed
him in a service of twenty-five years’ duration—Richard de
Lucy “the loyal”; but in the summer of 1179 Richard de
Lucy, to his master’s great regret, resigned his office of
justiciar and retired to end his days a few months later as a
brother of an Augustinian house which he had founded at
Lesnes in Kent to the honour of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas of Canterbury.<a id="Anchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 872.">[872]</a>
Henry in this extremity fell back once more upon a precedent
of his grandfather’s time and determined to place the
chief administration, for the moment at least, again in
clerical hands. Instead of a single justiciar-bishop, however,
he appointed three—the bishops of Winchester,
Ely and Norwich;<a id="Anchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 873.">[873]</a> all of whom, under their earlier
appellations of Richard of Ilchester, Geoffrey Ridel and
John of Oxford, had long ago acquired ample experience
and shewn ample capacity for the work of secular administration.<a id="Anchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 874.">[874]</a></p>

<p>This arrangement was however only provisional. The
number of judicial circuits was again raised to four, and to
each of the three southern circuits was despatched one of the
justiciar-bishops, with a royal clerk and three laymen to act
as his subordinate assistants. The fourth circuit, which
took in the whole district between the Trent and the Scottish
border, was intrusted to six justices, of whom only two were
clerks; one of these, Godfrey de Lucy the archdeacon of
Richmond, a brother of the late chief justiciar, stood nominally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">ii.177</a></span>
at the head of the commission; but there can be little
doubt that its real head was one of his lay colleagues—Ralf
de Glanville,<a id="Anchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 875.">[875]</a> the faithful sheriff of Lancashire and castellan
of Richmond to whom William the Lion had given up his
sword at Alnwick in 1174;<a id="Anchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 876.">[876]</a> and these six were appointed
to form the committee for hearing the complaints of the
people, apparently in succession to the five who had been
selected in the previous year.<a id="Anchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 877.">[877]</a> All four bodies of judges
brought up a report of their proceedings to the king at
Westminster on August 27,<a id="Anchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 878.">[878]</a> and it seems to have been the
most satisfactory which he had yet received. When he
went over sea in the following April, he left Ralf de Glanville
to represent him in England as chief justiciar.<a id="Anchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 879.">[879]</a> Ralf’s
business capacities proved to be at least as great, and his
honesty as stainless, as those of his predecessor; and from
that time forth the management of the entire legal and
judicial administration was left in his hands. Circuits,
variously distributed, continued to be made from year to
year and for divers purposes by companies of judges, ranging
in total numbers from three to twenty-two;<a id="Anchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 880.">[880]</a> while the
King’s Court and the Exchequer pursued their work on the
lines already laid down, without further interruption, till the

<p>The last of Henry’s great legal measures, with the exception
of a Forest Assize issued in 1184, was an ordinance
published in the autumn of 1181 and known as the Assize
of Arms. Its object was to define more fully and exactly
the military obligations of the people at large in the service
of the king and the defence of the country;—in a word, to
put once again upon a more definite footing the old institution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">ii.178</a></span>
of the “fyrd,” which was the only effective counterpoise
to the military power of the barons, and whose services in
1173 and 1174 had proved it to be well worthy of the
royal consideration and encouragement. The Assize of 1181
declared the obligation of bearing arms at the king’s command
to be binding upon every free layman in the realm.
The character of the arms with which men of various ranks
were required to provide themselves was defined according
to a graduated scale, from the full equipment of the knight
down to the mail-coat, steel-cap and spear of the burgher
and the simple freeman.<a id="Anchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 881.">[881]</a> The justices were directed to
ascertain, through the “lawful men” of the hundreds and
towns, what persons fell under each category, to enroll their
names, read out the Assize in their presence, and make them
swear to provide themselves with the proper accoutrements
before <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Hilary’s day.<a id="Anchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 882.">[882]</a> Every man’s arms were to be carefully
kept and used solely for the royal service; they were
not to be taken out of the country, or alienated in any way;<a id="Anchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 883.">[883]</a>
at their owner’s death they were to pass to his heir;<a id="Anchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 884.">[884]</a> if any
man possessed other arms than those required of him by the
Assize, he was to dispose of them in such a manner that
they might be used in the king’s service;<a id="Anchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 885.">[885]</a> and all this was
enforced by a stern threat of corporal punishment upon
defaulters.<a id="Anchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 886.">[886]</a></p>

<p>The freemen who were armed under this Assize had
little occasion to use their weapons so long as King Henry
lived. Within the four seas of Britain there was almost
unbroken peace till the end of his reign. The treaty with
Scotland was ratified by the public homage of William the
Lion to Henry and his son at York on August 10, 1175;<a id="Anchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 887.">[887]</a>
and thenceforth Henry’s sole trouble from that quarter was
the necessity of arbitrating between William and his unruly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">ii.179</a></span>
vassals in Galloway,<a id="Anchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 888.">[888]</a> and of advising him in his ecclesiastical
difficulties with the Roman see. The western border of
England was less secure than the northern; yet even in
Wales the authority of the English Crown had made a considerable
advance since Henry’s accession. His first Welsh
war, directed against the princes of North Wales in 1157,
had little practical result. A second expedition marched in
1163 against Rees Ap-Griffith, prince of South Wales, and
a lucky incident at the outset insured its success. Directly
in the king’s line of march from Shrewsbury into South
Wales, between Wenlock and Newport, there ran a streamlet
called Pencarn—a mountain-torrent passable only at certain
points. One of these was an ancient ford concerning which
a prophecy attributed to the enchanter Merlin declared:
“When ye shall see a strong man with a freckled face rush
in upon the Britons, if he cross the ford of Pencarn, then
know ye that the might of Cambria shall perish.” The
Welsh guarded this ford with the utmost care to prevent
Henry from crossing it; he, ignorant of the prophecy, sent
his troops over by another passage, and was about to follow
them himself, when a loud blast from their trumpets on the
opposite bank caused his horse to rear so violently that he
was obliged to turn away and seek a means of crossing elsewhere.
He found it at the fatal spot, and as the Welsh saw
him dash through the stream their hearts sank in despair.<a id="Anchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 889.">[889]</a>
He marched unopposed from one end of South Wales to
the other, through Glamorgan and Carmarthen as far as
Pencader;<a id="Anchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 890.">[890]</a> here Rees made his submission;<a id="Anchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 891.">[891]</a> and Rees
himself, Owen of North Wales, and several other Welsh
princes appeared and swore allegiance to King Henry and
his heir in that famous council of Woodstock where the
first quarrel arose between Henry and Thomas of Canterbury.<a id="Anchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 892.">[892]</a></p>

<p>Next year Rees, provoked as he alleged by Henry’s non-fulfilment
of his promises and also by the shelter given to
the slayer of his nephew by Earl Roger of Clare, harried the
whole border and roused all Wales to fling off the yoke of
the “Frenchmen,” as the Welsh still called their Norman
conquerors.<a id="Anchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 893.">[893]</a> Henry was obliged to delay his vengeance till
the following summer, when it furnished him with an
excellent pretext for escaping from his ecclesiastical and
political entanglements on the continent.<a id="Anchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 894.">[894]</a> He set out from
Oswestry<a id="Anchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 895.">[895]</a> at the head of a vast army drawn from all parts
of his dominions, both insular and continental, and reinforced
by Flemish and Scottish allies.<a id="Anchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 896.">[896]</a> All the princes of Wales
were arrayed against him, and both parties intended the
campaign to be decisive. But the wet climate of the Welsh
hills proved a more dangerous foe than the mountaineers
themselves; and after remaining for some time encamped at
Berwen, Henry was compelled to beat an ignominious
retreat, completely defeated by the ceaseless rain,<a id="Anchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 897.">[897]</a> and
venting his baffled wrath against the Welsh in a savage
mutilation of their hostages.<a id="Anchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 898.">[898]</a> For six years after this, as we
have seen, he never had time to visit his island realm at all,
and the daring “French” settlers in Wales or on its borders,
such as the Geraldines or the De Clares, were free to fight
their own battles and make their own alliances with the
Welsh just as they chose; it was not till Henry in 1171
followed them to their more distant settlement in Ireland
that he again entered South Wales. Then he used his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">ii.181</a></span>
opportunity for a series of personal interviews with Rees,<a id="Anchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 899.">[899]</a>
which ended in a lasting agreement. Rees was left, in the
phrase of his native chronicler, as the king’s “justice” over
all South Wales.<a id="Anchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 900.">[900]</a> How far he maintained, along the border
or within his own territories, the peace and order whose
preservation formed the main part of an English justiciar’s
duty, may be doubted; but in the rebellion of 1174 he
shewed his personal loyalty to the king by marching all the
way into Staffordshire to besiege Tutbury for him, and some
of his followers did equally good service in the suppression
of the Norman revolt.<a id="Anchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 901.">[901]</a> David of North Wales, too, if he
did nothing to help the king, at least resisted the temptation
of joining his enemies; and the war was no sooner fairly
over than, anxious that some reflection of the glories of
English royalty should be cast over his own house, he became
an eager suitor for the hand of Henry’s half-sister Emma—a
suit which Henry found it politic to grant.<a id="Anchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 902.">[902]</a> A few months
later, in June 1175, the king made an attempt to secure the
tranquillity of the border by binding all the barons of the
district in a sworn mutual alliance for its defence.<a id="Anchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 903.">[903]</a> The
attempt was not very successful; the border-warfare went on
in much the same way as of old; but it was not till the
summer of 1184 that it grew serious enough to call for
Henry’s personal intervention, and then a march to Worcester
sufficed to bring Rees of South Wales once more to his
feet.<a id="Anchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 904.">[904]</a></p>

According to the

Henry first “moved an army with extreme

<p>It was the latest-won dependency of the English crown
which during these years gave the most trouble to its wearer.
If Henry found it hard to secure fit instruments for the
work of government and administration in England, he
found it harder still to secure them for the same work in
Ireland. At the outbreak of the barons’ revolt he had at
once guarded against all danger of the rebels finding support
in Ireland by recalling the garrisons which he had left in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">ii.182</a></span>
Irish coast-towns and summoning the chief men of the new
vassal state, particularly Richard of Striguil and Hugh de
Lacy, to join him personally in Normandy.<a id="Anchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 905.">[905]</a> Richard served
him well in the war as commandant of the important border-fortress
of Gisors;<a id="Anchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 906.">[906]</a> and it may have been as a reward for
these services that he was sent back to Ireland as governor
in Hugh’s stead<a id="Anchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 907.">[907]</a> at the close of the year. For the next
two years, while the king had his hands full in Normandy
and England, matters in Ireland went much as they had
gone before his visit there; the Norman-English settlers
pursued their strifes and their alliances with their Irish
neighbours or with each other, and granted out to their
followers the lands which they won, entirely at their own
pleasure.<a id="Anchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 908.">[908]</a> But the lesson which Henry was meanwhile
teaching their brethren in England was not thrown away
upon them; and at the close of 1175 it was brought home
to them in another way. Roderic O’Conor, moved as it
seems by the fame of Henry’s successes, and also perhaps
by two papal bulls—Adrian’s famous “Laudabiliter,” and
another from the reigning Pope Alexander—which Henry
had lately caused to be published at Waterford,<a id="Anchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 909.">[909]</a> at last bent
his stubborn independence to send three envoys to the
English king with overtures for a treaty of peace. The
treaty was signed at Windsor on October 6. Roderic submitted
to become Henry’s liegeman, and to pay him a yearly
tribute of one hide “pleasing to the merchants” for every
ten head of cattle throughout Ireland; on these conditions
he was confirmed in the government and administration of
justice over the whole island, except Leinster, Meath and
Waterford, and authorized to reckon upon the help of the
royal constables in compelling the obedience of his vassals
and collecting from them their share of the tribute.<a id="Anchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 910.">[910]</a></p>

<p>This scheme might perhaps have answered at least as
well as a similar plan had answered during a few years in
South Wales, had it not been for the disturbed condition of
the English settlement. The death of Richard of Striguil
in 1176<a id="Anchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 911.">[911]</a> left the command in the hands of his brother-in-law
and constable, Raymond the Fat, who for some years
had been not only the leader of his forces, but also his chief
adviser and most indispensable agent in all matters political
and military.<a id="Anchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 912.">[912]</a> A jealous rival, however, had already brought
Raymond into ill repute at court,<a id="Anchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 913.">[913]</a> and the king’s seneschal
William Fitz-Aldhelm was sent to supersede him.<a id="Anchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 914.">[914]</a> William
appears to have been a loyal servant of the king, but his
tact and wisdom did not equal his loyalty. At the moment
of landing his suspicions were aroused by the imposing display
of armed followers with which Raymond came to meet
him; the muttered words which he incautiously suffered to
escape his lips—“I will soon put an end to all this!”—were
enough to set all the Geraldines against him at once; and
the impolitic haste and severity with which he acted upon
his suspicions, without waiting to prove their justice,<a id="Anchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 915.">[915]</a> drove
the whole body of the earlier settlers into such a state of
irritation that early in the next year Henry found it necessary
to recall him.<a id="Anchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 916.">[916]</a> Meanwhile the aggressive spirit of the
English settlers had made Henry’s treaty with Roderic almost
a dead letter. In defiance of the rights which that treaty
reserved to the Irish monarch, they had profited by the
mutual dissensions of the lesser native chieftains to extend
their own power far beyond the limits therein laid down. A
civil war in Munster had ended in its virtual subjugation by
Raymond and his Geraldine kinsfolk;<a id="Anchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 917.">[917]</a> a like pretext had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">ii.184</a></span>
served for an invasion of Connaught itself by Miles Cogan;<a id="Anchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 918.">[918]</a>
John de Courcy was in full career of conquest in Ulster.<a id="Anchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 919.">[919]</a>
Henry could scarcely have put a stop to all this, even had
he really wished to do so; and by this time he was probably
more inclined to encourage any extension of English power
in Ireland, for he had devised a new scheme for the government
of that country.</p>

<p id="Page_184a">The bride of John “Lackland,” Alice of Maurienne, had
died within a year of her betrothal.<a id="Anchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 920.">[920]</a> The marriage-contract
indeed provided that in case of such an event her sister
should take her place; but the connexion had begun too
inauspiciously for either Henry or Humbert to have any
desire of renewing it; and Henry now saw a possibility of
more than repairing within his insular dominions the ill-luck
which had befallen his plans of advancement on the continent
for his favourite child. In the autumn of 1176 John
was betrothed to his cousin Avice, the youngest of the three
daughters of Earl William of Gloucester, and Avice was
made heiress to the whole of the vast estates in the west of
England and South Wales which her father had inherited
from his parents, Earl Robert of Gloucester and Mabel of
Glamorgan.<a id="Anchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 921.">[921]</a> But a mere English earldom, however important,
was not enough to satisfy Henry’s ambition for his
darling. In his scheme Avice’s wealth was to furnish her
bridegroom with the means of supporting a loftier dignity.
He had now, it was said, obtained Pope Alexander’s leave
to make king of Ireland whichever of his sons he might
choose. On the strength of this permission he seems to
have reverted to his original scheme of conquering the whole
island.<a id="Anchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 922.">[922]</a> In May 1177 he publicly announced his intention
of bestowing the realm of Ireland upon his youngest son John,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">ii.185</a></span>
and parcelled out the southern half of the country among
a number of feudal tenants, who did homage for their new
fiefs to him and John in a great council at Oxford.<a id="Anchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 923.">[923]</a> As
however John was too young to undertake the government
in person, his father was again compelled to choose a viceroy.
He fell back upon his earliest choice and re-appointed Hugh
de Lacy;<a id="Anchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 924.">[924]</a> and with the exception of a temporary disgrace in
1181,<a id="Anchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 925.">[925]</a> it was Hugh who occupied this somewhat thankless
office during the next seven years. With the internal
history of Ireland during his administration and throughout
the rest of Henry’s reign we are not called upon to deal
here; for important as are its bearings upon the history of
England, their importance did not become apparent till a
much later time than that of the Angevin kings.</p>

such for the next seven years is certain, while there is, as far as I know, no indication
that his namesake of Chester ever was in Ireland at all. It seems therefore
that either the earl refused the office—or the king changed his mind—or the author
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta</i>, confused by the identity of Christian names, has substituted one

<p>It is during these years of prosperity and peace that we
are able to get the clearest view of the scope and aims of
Henry’s general scheme of home and foreign policy. That
policy, when fully matured in its author’s mind, formed a
consistent whole; it was however made up of two distinct
parts, originating in the twofold position of Henry himself.
His empire extended from the western shores of Ireland to
the Cévennes, and from the northernmost point of the mainland
of Britain to the Pyrenees. But this empire was composed
of a number of separate members over which his
authority differed greatly in character and degree. These<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">ii.186</a></span>
members, again, fell into two well-marked groups. Over
the one group Henry ruled as supreme head; no other
sovereign had ever claimed to be his superior, none now
claimed to be even his equal, within the British Isles. In
the other group, however, he had at least a nominal superior
in the king of France. It was impossible to deal with these
two groups of states on one and the same principle; and
Henry had never attempted to do so. The one group had
its centre in England, the other in Anjou. As a necessary
consequence, Henry’s policy had also two centres throughout
his reign. The key to it as a whole lies in its blending of
two characters united in one person, yet essentially distinct:
the character of the king of England and supreme lord of
the British Isles, and the character of the head of the house
of Anjou. Henry himself evidently kept the two characters
distinct in his own mind. His policy as king of England,
however little it may have been consciously aimed at such a
result—and we should surely be doing a great injustice to
Henry’s sagacity if we doubted that it was so aimed, at least
in some degree—certainly tended to make England a strong
and independent national state, with its vassal states, Scotland,
Wales and Ireland, standing around it as dependent allies.
If he had ever for a moment dreamed of reducing his insular
dominions to a mere subject-province of the empire which he
was building up in Gaul, when he thought of intrusting their
government to his boy-heir under the guardianship of Thomas,
that dream had been broken at once and for ever by the
quarrel which deprived the child of his guardian and the
king of his friend. But, on the other hand, Henry certainly
never at any time contemplated making his continental
empire a mere dependency of the English crown. It was
distinctly an Angevin empire, with its centre in the spot
whence an Angevin count had been promised of old that the
sway of his descendants should spread to the ends of the
earth. Henry in short had another work to carry on besides
that of Cnut and William and Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> He had to
carry on also the work of Fulk the Black and Geoffrey
Martel and Fulk <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr>; and although to us who know how
speedy was to be its overthrow that work looks a comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">ii.187</a></span>
small matter, yet at the time it may well have seemed
equally important with the other in the eyes both of Henry
and of his contemporaries. While what may be called the
English thread in the somewhat tangled skein of Henry’s life
runs smoothly and uneventfully on from the year 1175 to
the end, it is this Angevin thread which forms the clue to
the political and personal, as distinguished from the social
and constitutional, interest of all the remaining years of his
reign. And from this interest, although its centre is at
Angers, England is not excluded. For the whole continental
relations of Henry were coloured by his position as
an English king; and the whole foreign relations of England,
from his day to our own, have been coloured by the fact
that her second King Henry was also head of the Angevin
house when that house was at the height of its continental
power and glory.</p>

<p>The prophecy said to have been made to Fulk the
Good was now literally fulfilled. The dominions of his
posterity reached to the uttermost ends of the known world.
In the far east, one grandson of Fulk <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr> ruled over the little
strip of Holy Land which formed the boundary of Christendom
against the outer darkness of unexplored heathendom.
In the far west, another of Fulk’s grandsons was, formally at
least, acknowledged overlord of the island beyond which, in
the belief of those days, lay nothing but a sea without a
shore. Scarcely less remarkable, however, was the fulfilment
of the prediction in a narrower sense. The whole
breadth of Europe and the whole length of the Mediterranean
sea parted the western from the eastern branch of
the Angevin house. But in Gaul itself, the Angevin
dominion now stretched without a break from one end of
the land to the other. The Good Count’s heir held in his
own hands the whole Gaulish coast-line from the mouth of
the Somme to that of the Bidassoa, and he could almost
touch the Mediterranean Sea through his vassal the count of
Toulouse. Step by step the lords of the little Angevin
march had enlarged their borders till they enclosed more
than two-thirds of the kingdom of France. Fulk Nerra
and Geoffrey Martel had doubled their possessions by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">ii.188</a></span>
conquest of Touraine to the south-east; Fulk <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr> had tripled
them by the annexation of Maine to the northward; Geoffrey
Plantagenet’s marriage with the heiress of Normandy had
brought him to the shores of the English Channel. The
whole series of annexations and conquests whereby his son
expanded his continental dominions to the extent which they
covered thirty years after Geoffrey’s death resulted simply
from a continuation of the same policy which, a century and
a half before, had laid the foundations of the Angevin empire.
Count Henry Fitz-Empress stood in a figure, like Count
Fulk the Black, upon the rock of Angers, looked around
over his marchland and its borders, noted every point at
which those borders might be strengthened, rounded off or
enlarged, and set himself to the pursuit of Fulk Nerra’s work
in Fulk Nerra’s own spirit. For such a survey indeed he
needed a more wide-reaching vision than even that of the
Black Falcon. The work had altered vastly in scale since it
left the “great builder’s” hands; but it had not changed in
character. Henry’s policy in Gaul was essentially the same
as Fulk’s—a policy of consolidation, rather than of conquest.
He clearly never dreamed, as a man of less cautious ambition
might well have done in his place, of pitting the whole
strength of his continental and insular dominions against that
of the French Crown in a struggle for the mastery of Gaul;
he seems never to have dreamed even of trying to free himself
from his feudal obedience to a sovereign far inferior to him
in territorial wealth and power; he never, so far as we can
see, aspired to stand in any other relation to the French
king than that which had been held by his forefathers.
He aimed in fact simply at compacting and securing his
own territories in Gaul, and maintaining the rank of the head
of the Angevin house, as the most influential vassal of the
Crown. If he ever saw, on a distant horizon, a vision of
something greater than this, he kept his dream to himself and,
like Fulk of old, left his successors to attempt its fulfilment.</p>

<p>An ambition so moderate as this entailed no very complicated
schemes of foreign diplomacy. As a matter of fact,
Henry was at some time or other in his reign in diplomatic
relations with every state and every ruler in Christendom,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">ii.189</a></span>
from Portugal to Norway, and from the count of Montferrat
to the Eastern and Western Emperors. But these relations
sprang for the most part from his insular rather than from
his continental position; or, more exactly, they arose from
his position as a king of England, but a king far mightier
than any who had gone before him. It was the knowledge
that Henry had at his back all the forces of the island-crown
which roused in Louis <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr> such a restless jealousy of his
power in Gaul; and it was the jealousy of Louis which
drove Henry into a labyrinth of diplomacy and of war,
neither of which was a natural result of Henry’s own policy.
A very brief glance at Henry’s foreign relations will suffice
to shew that they concerned England far more than Anjou.
A considerable part of them arose directly out of his quarrel
with the English primate. Such was the case with his
German and Italian alliances, designed to counterbalance
the French king’s league with the Pope. The alliances
formed through the marriages of his daughters were all
strictly alliances made by the English Crown. The immediate
occasion of Matilda’s marriage with Henry of
Saxony was her father’s quarrel with <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas; in another
point of view, this union was only a natural continuation of
a policy which may be traced through the wedding of her
grandmother with Henry <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr> and that of Gunhild with Henry
<abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> back to the wedding of Æthelstan’s sister Eadgifu with
Charles the Simple. The marriages of Eleanor and Jane
were first planned during the same troubled time; in each
case the definite proposal came from the bridegroom, and
came in the shape of an humble suit to the king of England
for his daughter’s hand; and in the case of all three sisters,
the proposal was laid before a great council of the bishops
and barons of England, and only accepted after formal
deliberation upon it with them, as upon a matter which concerned
the interests of England as a state.<a id="Anchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 926.">[926]</a> When Jane
went to be married to the king of Sicily in 1176, the details<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">ii.190</a></span>

in short were instruments of his regal, his national, his
English policy; for the carrying out of his Angevin, his
family policy, he looked to his sons.</p>

<p>The arrangement by which he endeavoured to make
them carry it out is however not very easy to understand or
to account for. He had long since abandoned his early
scheme of devoting himself entirely to continental politics
and making England over to the hands of his eldest son.
That scheme, indeed, had been frustrated in the first instance
by his quarrel with Thomas; although it seemed to have
been revived in 1170, it was as a mere temporary expedient
to meet a temporary need; and the revolt of 1173 put an
end to it altogether, by proving clearly to Henry that he
must never again venture to delegate his kingly power and
authority to any one, even for a season. But, on the other
hand, it is not easy at once to see why, during the years
which followed, he persistently refused to give to his eldest
son as much real, though subordinate, power on the continent
as he was willing to give to the younger ones—why
young Henry was not suffered to govern Anjou and Normandy
as Richard was suffered to govern Aquitaine and
Geoffrey to govern Britanny, so soon as they were old
enough, under the control of their father as overlord. So
far as we can venture to guess at the king’s motives, the
most probable reason seems to be that he could not part
with any share of authority over his ancestral dominions
without parting at the same time with his ancestral dignities.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">ii.191</a></span>
From a strictly Angevin or Cenomannian point of view,
Aquitaine and Britanny were both simply appendages,
diversely acquired, to the hereditary Angevin and Cenomannian
dominions. Nay, from a strictly Norman point of view,
England itself was but an addition to the heritage of the
Norman ducal house. Henry might make over all these to
his sons as under-fiefs to govern in subjection to him, and
yet retain intact his position as head of the sovereign houses
of Normandy and Anjou. But to place his mother’s duchy
and his father’s counties in other hands—to reduce them to
the rank of under-fiefs, keeping for himself no closer connexion
with them than a mere general overlordship—would
have been, in principle, to renounce his birthright; while in
practice, it would probably have been equivalent to complete
abdication, as far as his continental empire was concerned.
Henry would have had as little chance of enforcing his
claim to overlordship without a territorial basis on which to
rest it, as a German Emperor without his hereditary duchy of
Saxony or Franconia or Suabia, or a French king without
his royal domain. In short, when Henry found it impossible
to give England to his eldest son, he had nothing else to
give him, unless he gave him all; and Henry Fitz-Empress
was no more inclined than William the Conqueror had been
to “take off his clothes before he was ready to go to bed.”
All his schemes for the distribution of his territories, therefore,
from 1175 onwards, were intended solely to insure a
fair partition among his sons after his own death; his
general aim being that young Henry should step into exactly
his own position as king of England, duke of Normandy and
count of Anjou, and overlord of Britanny, Aquitaine, and
all other dependencies of the Angevin and Norman coronets
or of the English crown.</p>

<p>None of the holders of these dependencies, however,
had as yet entered into full enjoyment of their possessions.
At the close of their first revolt, in 1175, the young king
was but just entering his twentieth year; Richard was in his
eighteenth and Geoffrey in his seventeenth year; and
although the one had been titular duke of Aquitaine and
the other titular duke of Britanny since 1169, the real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">ii.192</a></span>
government of both duchies, as well as that of Normandy
and Anjou, had been until now in the hands of their father.
For the purposes of our story there is only one part of these
continental possessions of our Angevin king into whose
internal concerns we need enter at any great length; a very
slight sketch may suffice for the others. The part which lay
nearest to England, and which politically was most closely
connected with it—the duchy of Normandy—was also
associated with it in many of Henry’s legal, constitutional
and administrative reforms. A comparison of dates indeed
would almost suggest that Henry, when contemplating a
great legal or administrative experiment in England, usually
tried it first in Normandy in order to test its working there
upon a small scale before he ventured on applying it to his
island realm. An edict issued at Falaise in the Christmas-tide
of 1159–1160, ordaining “that no dean should accuse
any man without the evidence of neighbours who bore a
good character, and that in the treatment of all causes, the
magistrates of the several districts at their monthly courts
should determine nothing without the witness of the neighbours,
should do injustice to no man and inflict nothing to
the prejudice of any, should maintain the peace, and should
punish all robbers summarily,”<a id="Anchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 929.">[929]</a> seems to contain a foreshadowing
at once of some of the Constitutions of Clarendon
which created such excitement in England four years afterwards,
and of the Assize which followed two years later still.
A commission of inquiry into the administration of the
Norman episcopal sees and viscounties in 1162<a id="Anchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 930.">[930]</a> was a sort
of forerunner of the great inquest into the conduct of the
English sheriffs in 1170. This again was followed next
year, as we have seen, by an inquiry into the state of the
ducal forests and demesnes,<a id="Anchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 931.">[931]</a> which has its English parallels
in the great forest assize of 1176 and in an inquest into the
condition of the royal demesnes ordered in the spring of
1177.<a id="Anchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 932.">[932]</a> On the other hand, a roll of the Norman tenants-in-chivalry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">ii.193</a></span>
compiled in 1172 seems to have been modelled
upon the English “Black Book” of 1168;<a id="Anchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 933.">[933]</a> and when Henry
determined to institute a thorough reform in the whole
Norman administration, it was at the English exchequer-table
that he found his instrument for the work. In 1176
William de Courcy, the seneschal of Normandy, died. In
his stead the king appointed Richard of Ilchester. Richard,
to judge by his surname, must have been an Englishman by
birth; from the second year of Henry’s reign he was
employed as a “writer” in the royal treasury;<a id="Anchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 934.">[934]</a> about 1163
he was made archdeacon of Poitiers, but his archidiaconal
functions sat as lightly upon him as upon a contemporary
whose name is often associated with his, Geoffrey Ridel,
archdeacon of Canterbury and vice-chancellor; and throughout
the struggle with Archbishop Thomas he was one of the
most active agents of Henry’s foreign diplomacy.<a id="Anchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 935.">[935]</a> Unlike
his colleagues Geoffrey Ridel and John of Oxford, he contrived,
notwithstanding the ecclesiastical disgrace in which
he became involved through his dealings with the schismatic
Emperor and the antipope, to retain the general respect of
all parties among his fellow-countrymen.<a id="Anchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 936.">[936]</a> Throughout
the same period, when not absent from England on some
diplomatic mission, he frequently appears as an acting justice
of the King’s Court and baron of the Exchequer.<a id="Anchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 937.">[937]</a> He
continued to fulfil the same duties after his elevation to the
see of Winchester in 1174; and the estimation in which he
was held is shewn by the fact that on his return from
Normandy, where he was replaced at the end of two years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">ii.194</a></span>
by William Fitz-Ralf,<a id="Anchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 938.">[938]</a> a special seat was assigned to him at
the exchequer-table between the presiding justiciar and the
treasurer, “that he might diligently examine what was
written on the roll.”<a id="Anchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 939.">[939]</a> He was evidently invested with far
more authority in Normandy than that which usually appertained
to a Norman seneschal—authority, in fact, more like
that of an English justiciar; indeed, he is actually called
justiciar, and not seneschal, by contemporary English writers.<a id="Anchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 940.">[940]</a>
His work in the duchy seems to have been moreover specially
connected with finance;<a id="Anchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 941.">[941]</a> and we may perhaps venture to see
a trace of his hand in the organization of the Norman Court
of Exchequer, which first comes distinctly to light in Henry’s
latter years, its earliest extant roll being that of the year
1180.<a id="Anchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 942.">[942]</a> The earlier stages of the legal and administrative
organization of Normandy are, however, so lost in obscurity
that neither constitutional lawyers in Henry’s day nor constitutional
historians in our own have been able to determine
the exact historical relation of the Norman system to that
of England;<a id="Anchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 943.">[943]</a> and the speedy severance of the political
connexion between them makes the determination of the
question, after all, of little practical moment.</p>

Except, of course, the immediate personal friends of the archbishop, to whom
he seems to have been even more obnoxious than the “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">archidiabolus</i>” Geoffrey Ridel—that
is, supposing Mr. Eyton to be right in his theory that Richard of Ilchester
is the person designated in the private letters of Thomas and his friends as
“Luscus.” Canon Robertson, however, took “Luscus” to mean Richard de
Lucy; but the other interpretation seems on the whole more probable.

<p>Even more obscure than the internal history of Normandy
under Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> is that of Anjou and of the two
dependencies which may now be reckoned as one with it,
Touraine and Maine. There is in his time throughout the
whole of his dominions, with the marked exception of England,
a dearth of historical records. Normandy cannot boast
of a single historian such as those of the preceding generation,
Orderic or William of Jumièges; the only Norman
chronicle of any importance is that of Robert of Torigny,
commonly known as “Robert <i>de Monte</i>,” from the Mont-<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Michel
of which he was abbot; and even his work is
nothing more than a tolerably full and accurate chronicle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">ii.195</a></span>
of the old-fashioned type, arranged on the annalistic plan
“according to the years of our Lord” which William
of Malmesbury had condemned long ago. The Breton
chronicles, always meagre, grow more meagre still as the
years pass on; the same may be said of the chronicles of
Tours; the “Acts of the bishops of Le Mans,” our sole
native authority for the history of Maine, cease to record
anything save purely ecclesiastical details. In Anjou itself
the recent aggrandizement of the Angevin house stirred up
in Henry’s early years a spirit of patriotic loyalty which led
more than one of his subjects to collect the floating popular
traditions of his race, as the ballads and tales of old England
had been collected by Henry of Huntingdon and
William of Malmesbury, and weave them into a narrative
which passed for a history of the Angevin counts; and one
of these writers supplemented his work with a special memoir
of Henry’s father, Geoffrey duke of the Normans. But the
reign of Henry himself found no historian in the Marchland;
and indeed the half-blank pages of the few monastic chronicles
which still dragged out a lingering existence in one or two
of the great Angevin abbeys shew us that under Count
Henry Fitz-Empress Anjou was once more, as of old under
Count Fulk the Good, happy in having no history.</p>

<p>Yet it is there, and there alone, that we can catch a
glimpse of one side of his character which, if we saw him
only in England or in Normandy, we should hardly have
discerned at all. Strange as it seems to us who know him
in his northern realms only as the enterprising and somewhat
unscrupulous politician, the stern and vigorous ruler,
the hard-headed statesman, the uncompromising opponent
of the Church’s claims, Henry is yet the one Angevin count
who completely reproduced in his Marchland, as a living
reality, the ideal which was represented there by the name
of the good count-canon of Tours. Fulk the Black and
Fulk the Fifth had both tried to reproduce it, each according
to his lights, during those few years when the pressure of
external politics and warfare left them free to devote their
energies for a while to their country’s internal welfare. But
Henry’s whole reign was, for his paternal dominions, a reign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">ii.196</a></span>
of peace. If we drew our ideas of him solely from the
traces and traditions which he has left behind him there,
we could never have guessed that he was a greater warrior
than Fulk Nerra; we should rather have taken him for a
quiet prince who, like Fulk the Good, “waged no wars.”
These traces and traditions lie scattered over the soil of
Anjou, Touraine and Maine as thickly as the traces and the
traditions of the Black Count himself. Henry is in fact the
only one of the later Angevin counts who made upon the
imagination of his people an impression even approaching
in vividness to that left by Fulk the Black, and of whose
material works there remains anything which can be compared
with those of the “great builder” of the preceding
century. But the memory which Anjou has retained of
Henry differs much in character from that which she has
kept of Fulk; and it differs more widely still from that
which Henry himself has left in his island-realm. In English
popular tradition he appears simply as the hero of a foolish
and discreditable romance, or as the man who first caused the
murder of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas and then did penance at his grave;
and material traces of him there are literally none, for of his
English dwelling-places not one stone is left upon another,
and not a single surviving monument of public utility,
secular or ecclesiastical, is connected with his name. In
the valley of the Loire it was far otherwise. There the two
great Angevin builders share between them the credit of
well-nigh all the more important monuments which give life
to the medieval history of the land—except the military
constructions, which belong to Fulk alone. It is not in
donjons such as that of Loches or Montrichard, but in
palaces and hospitals, bridges and embankments, that we
see our Angevin king’s handiwork in his own home-lands.
Almost every one of his many local capitals was adorned
during his reign with a palace of regal dimensions and
magnificence, reared by him in place of the lowlier “halls”
which had served for the dwelling of the merely local rulers
whom he succeeded. The rebuilding of the ducal palace at
Rouen was begun in 1161;<a id="Anchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 944.">[944]</a> that of Caen was nearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">ii.197</a></span>
finished in 1180; its hall, which still exists, is the traditional
seat of the Norman Exchequer.<a id="Anchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 945.">[945]</a> At Tours a round
tower which still stands in the barrack-yard is the sole surviving
fragment of a castle which Henry is said to have
built. His favourite abode in Touraine, however, was not
at Tours but at Chinon, where the little fortress above the
Vienne which had been the last conquest of Fulk Nerra and
the lifelong prison of Geoffrey the Bearded grew under
Henry’s hands into a royal retreat of exquisite beauty and
splendour—a gem, even now in its ruin, worthy of its setting
in the lovely valley of the Vienne, with the background of
good greenwood which to Henry was probably its greatest
charm. Angers, again, almost put on a new face in the
course of Henry’s lifetime. In the year before his birth it
had been visited by a fire which reduced to almost total
ruin its whole south-western quarter, including the palace of
the counts,<a id="Anchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 946.">[946]</a> of which nothing but the great hall seems to
have remained. The work of reconstruction, begun no
doubt by Geoffrey Plantagenet, was completed on a regal
scale by his son, and before the close of Henry’s reign
a visitor from England, Ralf de Diceto, could gaze in
admiration at the “vast palace,” with its “newly-built
apartments, adorned with splendour befitting a king,” which
rose at the foot of the vine-clad hills above the purple stream
of Mayenne.<a id="Anchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 947.">[947]</a></p>

<p>But the count-king did not build for himself alone. It
was, above all, with works of public usefulness that he
delighted to adorn his realms. His beneficence indeed took
a different shape from that of his predecessors. Church-building
and abbey-founding met with little sympathy from
him; throughout his whole dominions, only six religious
houses, in the strict sense, could claim him as their founder;
and even one of these was as much military as religious,
for it was a commandery of knights Templars.<a id="Anchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 948.">[948]</a> But no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">ii.198</a></span>
sovereign was ever more munificent in providing for the
sick and needy. Not only do the Norman Exchequer-rolls
contain frequent mention of sums set apart out of the ducal
revenues for the support of lazar-houses and hospitals in the
chief towns of the several bailiwicks;<a id="Anchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 949.">[949]</a> nineteen years before
the completion of his own palace at Caen, he had founded
an hospital for lepers outside the walls of the town;<a id="Anchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 950.">[950]</a> and a
park and hunting-lodge which he had made for himself in
the same year, 1161, at Quévilly by Rouen<a id="Anchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 951.">[951]</a> were shortly
afterwards given up by him to a colony of monks from
Grandmont in Aquitaine, to be converted under their care
into another great asylum for victims of the same disease.<a id="Anchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 952.">[952]</a>
At his own native Le Mans, the great hall of an almshouse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">ii.199</a></span>
or hospital outside the north-eastern boundary of the city,
said to have been reared by him for the reception of its
poor and sick folk, is still to be seen, though long since
perverted to other uses. At Angers, on the other hand,
it is only within the last half-century that the sick and
disabled poor have exchanged for a more modern dwelling
the shelter provided for them by Henry Fitz-Empress.
Some time in the quiet years which followed the barons’
revolt, Stephen,<a id="Anchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 953.">[953]</a> the seneschal of Anjou, bought of the
abbess and convent of our Lady of Charity at Angers a plot
of ground which lay between their abbey and the river, and
on which he designed to build an hospice for the poor. In
the last days of 1180 or the first days of 1181 the count-king
took under his own care the work which his seneschal
had begun, granted to the new hospital a rich endowment in
lands and revenues, exempted it from secular charges and
imposts, and won from Pope Alexander a confirmation of its
spiritual independence.<a id="Anchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 954.">[954]</a> Four priests were appointed to
minister to the spiritual needs of its inmates; the care of
their bodies was undertaken at first, it seems, by some pious
laymen bound by no special rule; some years later, however,
the hospital became, like most other establishments of the
kind, affiliated to the Order of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Augustine.<a id="Anchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 955.">[955]</a> The pretty
little chapel—dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> John the Baptist, and still
standing,—the cloisters and the domestic offices were all
finished before Henry’s death;<a id="Anchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 956.">[956]</a> while of the two great
pillared halls which now form the chief architectural glory
of the suburb, one, the smaller and simpler, is clearly of his
building; and the other, more vast and beautiful, is in all
probability the last legacy of his sons to the home which
was soon to be theirs no longer.<a id="Anchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 957.">[957]</a></p>

Founded in 1173, at Vaubourg in the forest of Roumare—an old hunting-seat
of his Norman grandfather;

Of the other houses, three were Austin priories: <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Laurence at
Beauvoir in the forest of Lions, founded while Henry was still only duke of Normandy
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page 114">p. cxiv</abbr></cite>);
Newstead, in Sherwood Forest, founded before 1174 (its
foundation-charter, dated at Clarendon, has no mention of day or year, but is
witnessed by “Geoffrey archdeacon of Canterbury,” who in 1174 became a
bishop;
    <cite>Dugdale, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Monasticon Anglicanum">Monast. Angl.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 6">vol. vi.</abbr> <abbr title="part 1">pt. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 474</cite>);
and the priory “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Beatae">B.</abbr> Mariæ Mellinensis</span>,” near La Flèche, founded in 1180
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Gallia Christiana">Gall. Christ.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 14">vol. xiv.</abbr>
<abbr title="column">col.</abbr> 600</cite>.
I cannot identify this place). The other two were Carthusian
houses, Witham in the forest of Selwood and Le Liget in that of Loches,
founded respectively in 1174 and 1175. (The date of Le Liget is traditional;
I cannot find any mention of the place in
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Gallia Christiana">Gall. Christ.</abbr></i></cite>)
Of all these, Witham is
the only one of any consequence; and the importance of even Witham lies chiefly
in its connexion with <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Hugh. (For its history see
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magna Vita <abbr title="Sancti">S.</abbr> Hugonis</i>,
Dimock, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 52 <i>et seq.</i></cite>)
The insignificance of the others is shewn by Gerald’s
account of Henry’s religious foundations, in
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="De instructione principis">De Instr. Princ.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="part 2">dist. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 7 (<abbr title="Anglia Christiana Society">Angl.
Christ. Soc.</abbr>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 27, 28)</cite>—an
account, however, which is by no means fair.
Henry on his absolution for <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas’s death, in 1172, promised to go on
a crusade of three years’ duration
    (<cite><abbr title="Roger of">Rog.</abbr> Howden, Stubbs, <abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 37</cite>);
this
undertaking he was afterwards allowed to exchange for a promise that he would
build three religious houses in his dominions. According to Gerald, he managed
one of these by turning the nuns out of Amesbury and putting a colony from
Fontevraud in their place (see
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Gesta Henrici">Gesta Hen.</abbr></i>, Stubbs, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 134–136, 165</cite>),
and another by turning the secular canons out of Waltham and putting regulars in
their place
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 134, 135, 173, 174, 316, 317</cite>.
Both these transactions took
place in 1177.) “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tertium vero</span>,” says Gerald (as above) “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vel nullum, vel simile
prioribus sibique prorsus inutile fecit; nisi forte domum conventualem ordinis
Cartusiensis de Witham, <abbr title="scilicet">s.</abbr> modicis sumptibus et exilem, ad hoc fecisse dicatur</span>.”
No doubt Witham was one of the three. But the other two are easily found;
they were Newstead and Vaubourg or Le Liget. <abbr title="Ralf">R.</abbr> Niger (Anstruther, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 168) is
as unjust to Henry in this matter as Gerald; but so he is on most others also.

valleys of the Loire and its tributaries. “Well-nigh disappearing
in summer, choked within their sandy beds,” these
streams were all too apt, as Ralf de Diceto says of the
Mayenne, to “rage and swell in winter like the sea;”<a id="Anchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 960.">[960]</a> and
the greatest and most lasting of all Henry’s material benefactions
to Anjou was the embankment or “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Levée</i>”—a work
which he seems characteristically to have planned and executed
in the very midst of his struggle with the Church<a id="Anchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 961.">[961]</a>—which
stretches along Loire-side, from Ponts-de-Cé, just
above the junction of the Mayenne and the Loire, some
thirty miles eastward to Bourgueil. Further south, in the
valley of the Vienne, the legend of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont de l’Annonain</span>”
illustrates the curious but not altogether unaccountable confusion
which grew up in popular imagination between the
two great builders of Anjou. The “bridge,” a long viaduct
which stretched from Chinon across river and meadow south-westward
to the village of Rivière, was in reality built by
Henry to secure a safe transit from Chinon into Poitou
across the low ground on the south bank of the Vienne,
which in rainy seasons was an all but impassable swamp.
Later ages, however, connected it with a dim tradition, which
still lingered in the district, of the wonderful night-ride across
Loire and Vienne whereby Fulk Nerra had won Saumur,
and in the belief of the peasantry the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont de l’Annonain</span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">ii.201</a></span>
became a “devil’s bridge,” built in a single night by the
Black Count’s familiar demon<a id="Anchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 962.">[962]</a>—a demon who is but a
popular personification of that spirit of dauntless enterprise
and ceaseless activity which, alike in their material and in
their political workmanship, was the secret of Henry’s
success no less than of Fulk’s.</p>

<p>One portion, however, of Henry’s continental dominions
has during these years a political and military history of its
own, which is not without a bearing upon that of our own
land. Geographically remote as it was from England, still
more remote in the character of both country and people,
Aquitaine yet concerns us more than any other part of
Henry’s Gaulish possessions. For not only was it a chief
source of the political complications which filled the closing
years of his life; it was the only one of those possessions
whose connexion with England survived the fall of the
Angevin house. The heritages of Geoffrey and Matilda
were lost by their grandson; the heritage of Eleanor remained,
in part at least, in the hands of her descendants for
more than two hundred years.</p>

<p>It was in truth a dower at once valuable and burdensome
that Henry had received with his Aquitanian wife.
She had made him master of a territory whose extent surpassed
that of all his Norman and Angevin dominions put
together, and was scarcely equalled by that of England—a
territory containing every variety of soil and of natural
characteristics, from the flat, rich pastures of Berry and the
vineyards of Poitou and Saintonge to the rugged volcanic
rocks and dark chestnut-woods of Auvergne, the salt marshes,
sandy dunes, barren heaths and gloomy pine-forests of the
Gascon coast, and the fertile valleys which open between
the feet of the Pyrenees<span class="nobreak">:—</span>a territory whose population
differed in blood and speech from their fellow-subjects north
of Loire almost as widely as Normans and Angevins differed
from Englishmen; while in temper and modes of thought
and life they stood so apart from the northern world that in
contradistinction to them Angevins and Normans and
English might almost be counted, and indeed were almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">ii.202</a></span>
ready to count themselves, as one people. It was a territory,
too, whose political relations varied as much as its physical
character, and were full of dangers which all Henry’s vigilance
and wisdom were powerless to guard against or overcome.
Setting aside, for the moment, the internal difficulties of
Aquitaine, its whole eastern frontier, from the banks of the
Cher to the Pyrenees, was more or less in dispute throughout
his reign. The question of Toulouse, indeed, was settled in
1173; thenceforth the county of Toulouse, with its northern
dependencies Rouergue and Alby, became a recognized
underfief of the Poitevin duchy of Aquitaine, to which its
western dependency, Quercy or the county of Cahors, had
been already annexed after the war of 1160. The north-eastern
portions of the older Aquitania, Berry and Auvergne,
were sources of more lasting trouble. Berry had long ago
been split into two unequal portions, of which the larger
had remained subject to the dukes of Aquitaine, while the
smaller northern division formed the viscounty of Bourges,
and was an immediate fief of the French Crown. Naturally, the
king was disposed to use every opportunity of thwarting the
duke in the exercise of his authority over southern Berry;
and Henry was equally desirous to lose no chance of re-asserting
his ducal rights over Bourges.<a id="Anchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 963.">[963]</a> The feudal position
of Auvergne was a standing puzzle which king and duke,
count, clergy and people, all in vain endeavoured to solve.
During the struggle for supremacy in southern Gaul between
the houses of Poitiers and Toulouse, Auvergne, after fluctuating
for nearly a hundred years between the rival
dukedoms, had virtually succeeded in freeing itself from
the control of both, and in the reign of Louis <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> it seems
to have been regarded as an immediate fief of the French
Crown, to which however it proved a most unruly and
troublesome possession. But the dukes of Aquitaine had
never relinquished their claim to its overlordship; and when
a quarrel broke out between two rival claimants of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">ii.203</a></span>
county, it was naturally followed by a quarrel between Henry
and Louis <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr> as to their respective rights, as overlord and
as lord paramount, to act as arbiters in the strife.<a id="Anchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 964.">[964]</a> During
five-and-twenty years it was a favourite device of Louis and
of his successor, at every adverse crisis in Henry’s fortune,
to despatch a body of troops into Auvergne to occupy that
country and threaten Aquitaine through its eastern marches,<a id="Anchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 965.">[965]</a>
just as they habitually threatened Normandy through the
marches of the Vexin.</p>

His first attempt to do so was made in 1170, when a pretext was given him
by the declaration said—whether truly or falsely—to have been made by the dying
archbishop Peter of Bourges, that his see belonged of right to Aquitaine. Nothing,

<p>Such a threat implied a far more serious danger in the
south than in the north. The Aquitanian border was guarded
by no such chain of strongly-fortified, stoutly-manned ducal
castles as girt in the Norman duchy from Gisors to Tillières;
and Henry’s hold over his wife’s dominions was very different
from his grasp of the heritage of his mother. Twenty years
of Angevin rule, which for political purposes had well-nigh
bridged over the channel that parted England from Gaul,
seem to have done nothing towards bridging over the gulf
that parted Aquitaine from France and Anjou. If our
Angevin king sometimes looks like a stranger amongst us,
he was never anything but a stranger among the fellow-countrymen
of his wife. Nowhere throughout his whole
dominions was a spirit of revolt and insubordination so rife
as among the nobles of Poitou and its dependencies; but it
was a spirit utterly unlike the feudal pride of the Norman
baronage. The endless strife of the Aquitanian nobles with
their foreign duke and with each other sprang less from
political motives than from a love of strife for its own sake;
and their love of strife was only one phase of the passion
for adventure and excitement which ran through every fibre
of their nature and coloured every aspect of their social life.
The men of the south lived in a world where the most
delicate poetry and the fiercest savagery, the wildest moral
and political disorder, and the most refined intellectual
culture, mingled together in a confusion as picturesque as it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">ii.204</a></span>
was dangerous. The southern warrior was but half a knight
if the sword was his only weapon—if he could not sing his
battles as well as fight them. From raid and foray and
siege he passed to the “Court of Love,” where the fairest
and noblest women of the land, from the duchess herself
downwards, presided over contests of subtle wit, skilful rime
and melodious song, conducted under rules as stringent and
with earnestness as deep as if life and death were at stake
upon the issue; and in truth they sometimes were at stake,
for song, love and war all mingled together in the troubadour’s
life in an inextricable coil which the less subtle intellects of
the north would have been powerless to unravel or comprehend.
The <i>sirvente</i> or poetical satire with which he stung
his enemies into fury or roused the slumbering valour of his
friends often wrought more deadly mischief than sharp steel
or blazing firebrand. The nature of the men of the south
was like that of their country: it was made up of the most
opposite characteristics—of the lightest fancies, the stormiest
passions, the most versatile capabilities of body and mind,
the most indolent love of ease and pleasure, the most restless
and daring valour, the highest intellectual refinement and the
lowest moral degradation. It was a nature which revolted
instinctively from constraint in any direction,—whose impetuosity
burst all control of law and order imposed from
without upon its restless love of action and adventure, just
as it overflowed all conventional bounds of thought and
language with its exuberant play of feeling and imagination
in speech or song.<a id="Anchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 966.">[966]</a> We may see a type of it in the portrait,
drawn by almost contemporary hands, of one who played an
important part both in the social and in the political history
of Aquitaine throughout the closing years of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> and
the reign of his successor. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">ii.205</a></span>“Bertrand de Born was of the
Limousin, lord of a castle in the diocese of Périgueux, by
name Hautefort. He had at his command near a thousand
men. And all his time he was at war with all his neighbours,
with the count of Périgord, and the viscount of
Limoges, and with his own brother Constantine—whom he
would have liked to disinherit, had it not been for the king
of England—and with Richard, while he was count of Poitou.
He was a good knight, and a good warrior, and a good
servant of ladies, and a good troubadour of <i>sirventes</i>; he
never made but two songs, and the king of Aragon assigned
the songs of Guiraut de Borneil as wives to his <i>sirventes</i>;
and the man who sang them for him was named Papiol.
And he was a pleasant, courteous man, wise and well-spoken,
and knew how to deal with good and evil. And whenever
he chose, he was master of King Henry and his sons; but
he always wanted them to be at war among themselves, the
father and the sons and the brothers one with another; and
he always wanted the king of France and King Henry to be
at war too. And if they made peace or a truce, he immediately
set to work to unmake it with his <i>sirventes</i>, and
to shew how they were all dishonoured in peace. And he
gained much good by it, and much harm.”<a id="Anchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 967.">[967]</a></p>

<p>Until the dukedom of Aquitaine passed to a woman, as
were the vassals, so was their sovereign. Eleanor’s grandfather
the crusader-duke William <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr> and her father
William <abbr title="the Ninth">IX.</abbr> were simply the boldest knights, the gayest
troubadours and the most reckless adventurers in their duchy.
There can be no doubt that the submission of Aquitaine to
Louis <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr>, so far as it ever did submit to him, was due to
Eleanor’s influence; and it was the same influence which
chiefly contributed to preserve its obedience to her second
husband during those earlier years of their married life when,
at home and abroad, all things had seemed destined to
prosper in his hands. But at the first symptom of a turn in
the tide of his fortunes, southern Gaul at one rose against its
northern master. Eleanor’s tact and firmness, Henry’s wariness
and vigour, were all taxed to the uttermost in holding
it down throughout the years of his struggle with the Church;
and when Eleanor herself turned against him in 1173, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">ii.206</a></span>
chances of a good understanding between her subjects and
her husband became very nearly desperate. Henry himself
seems to have long ago perceived that a duke of Aquitaine,
to be thoroughly sure of his ground, needed a different apprenticeship
from that which might befit a king of England,
a duke of Normandy or Britanny, or a count of Anjou.
The very first step in his plans for the future of his children—a
step taken several years before he seems even to have
thought of crowning his eldest son—was the designation of
the second as his mother’s destined colleague and ultimate
heir. Richard had been trained up ever since he was two
years old specially for the office of duke of Aquitaine. After
long diplomacy, and at the cost of a betrothal which became
the source of endless mischief and trouble, the French king’s
sanction to the arrangement had been won; and on Trinity-Sunday
1172 Richard, in his mother’s presence, had been
formally enthroned at Poitiers. He was probably intended
to govern the duchy under her direction and advice; if so,
however, the plan was frustrated by Eleanor’s own conduct
and by the suspicions which it aroused in her husband. She
was one of the very few captives whom at the restoration of
peace in 1175 he still retained in confinement. Richard,
on the other hand, had been like his brothers fully and freely
forgiven; and while his father and eldest brother went to
seal their reconciliation in England, he was sent into Poitou
charged with authority to employ its forces at his own
discretion, and to take upon himself the suppression of all
disturbance and disorder in Aquitaine.<a id="Anchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 968.">[968]</a></p>

</ul>

<p>What had been the precise nature of Richard’s training
for his appointed work—what proportion of his seventeen
years’ life had been actually spent in Aquitaine, what opportunities
he had had of growing familiar with the people over
whom he was now set to rule—we have no means of determining.
By his own natural temper, however, he was probably
of all Eleanor’s sons the one least fitted to gain the
goodwill of the south. The “Cœur-de-lion” of tradition,
indeed—the adventurous crusader, the mirror of knightly
prowess and knightly courtesy, the lavish patron of verse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">ii.207</a></span>
and song, the ideal king of troubadours and knights-errant—looks
at first glance like the very incarnation of the spirit of
the south. But it was only in the intellectual part of his
nature that his southern blood made itself felt; the real
groundwork of his character was made of sterner stuff. The
love of splendour and elegance, the delight in poetry and
music,<a id="Anchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 969.">[969]</a> the lavish generosity, the passion for adventure, which
contrasted so vividly with his father’s practical businesslike
temper, came to him without doubt from his mother.
The moral deficiencies and evil tendencies of his nature he
himself charged, somewhat too exclusively, upon the demon-blood
of the Angevin counts.<a id="Anchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 970.">[970]</a> But we need not look either
to an ancestress so shadowy and so remote as the demon-countess,
nor to a land so far distant from us as Poitou, for
the source of Richard’s strongest characteristics both of body
and of mind. In him alone among Henry’s sons can we see
a likeness to the Norman forefathers of the Empress Matilda.
His outward aspect, his lofty stature, his gigantic strength—held
in check though it was by the constantly-recurring ague
which “kept him, fearless, in a tremor as continual as the
tremor of fear in which he kept the rest of the world”<a id="Anchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 971.">[971]</a>—his
blue eyes and golden hair, all proclaimed him a child of
the north. And although he spent the chief part of his life
elsewhere, the slender share of local and national sympathies
which he possessed seems to have lain in the same direction.
The “lion-heart” chose its own last earthly resting-place at
Rouen, not at Poitiers;<a id="Anchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 972.">[972]</a> and the intimate friend and comrade
whose name is inseparably associated with his by a
tradition which, whatever its historical value, is as famous as
it is beautiful, was no Poitevin or Provençal troubadour, but
a trouvère from northern France.<a id="Anchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 973.">[973]</a> The influence of his
northman-blood shewed itself more vividly still when on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">ii.208</a></span>
voyage to Palestine, having lived to be more than thirty years
old without possessing a skiff that he could call his own, or—unless
indeed in early childhood he had gone a cruise round
his father’s island-realm—ever making a longer or more
adventurous voyage than that from Southampton to Barfleur or
Wissant, he suddenly developed not only a passionate love
of the sea, but a consummate seamanship which he certainly
had had no opportunity of acquiring in any way, and which
can only have been born in him, as an inheritance from his
wiking forefathers. When scarcely more than a boy in years,
Richard was already one of the most serious and determined
of men. His sternness to those who “withstood his will”
matched that of the Conqueror himself; and Richard’s will,
even at the age of seventeen, was no mere caprice, but a
fixed determination which overrode all obstacles between itself
and its object as unhesitatingly as the old wiking-keels
overrode the billows of the northern sea. He went down
into Aquitaine fully resolved that the country should be at
once, and once for all, reduced to submission and order. He
set himself “to bring the shapeless into shape, to reduce the
irregular to rule, to cast down the things that were mighty
and level those that were rugged; to restore the dukedom of
Aquitaine to its ancient boundaries and its ancient government.”<a id="Anchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 974.">[974]</a>
He did the work with all his might, but he did it
with a straightforward ruthlessness untempered by southern
craft or Angevin caution and tact. He would not conciliate;
he could not wait. “He thought nothing done while anything
still remained to do; and he cared for no success that
was not reached by a path cut by his own sword and
stained with his opponent’s blood. Boiling over with zeal
for order and justice, he sought to quell the audacity of this
ungovernable people and to secure the safety of the innocent
amid these workers of mischief by at once proceeding against
the evil-doers with the utmost rigour which his ducal authority
could enable him to exercise upon them.”<a id="Anchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 975.">[975]</a> In a word, before
Richard had been six months in their midst, the Aquitanians
discovered that if their Angevin duke had chastised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">ii.209</a></span>
them with whips, the son of their own duchess was minded
to chastise them with scorpions.</p>

<p>He set off at once upon a furious campaign against the
strongholds of the unruly barons. “No mountain-side however
steep and rugged, no tower however lofty and impregnable,
availed to check his advance, as skilful as it was
daring, as steady and persevering as it was impetuous.”<a id="Anchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 976.">[976]</a>
By midsummer the castles of Poitou itself were mostly in
his hands, and the young conqueror was busy with the siege
of Castillonnes-sur-Agen, which surrendered to him in the
middle of August.<a id="Anchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 977.">[977]</a> Before the winter was over he was
master of Périgueux, and had, in the phrase of a local writer,
well-nigh “disinherited” the barons of Périgord, the Quercy
and the Limousin. But in the spring their smouldering
resentment was kindled into a blaze by the incitements of
Bertrand de Born, whose brother Constantine, expelled by
him from the castle of Hautefort which the two brothers
had inherited in common, had appealed to Richard for
succour; the signal for revolt, given by Bertrand in a
vigorous <i>sirvente</i>, was answered by all the malcontents of
the district,<a id="Anchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 978.">[978]</a> and at the opposite end of Poitou by the count
of Angoulême; and at Easter Richard found his position so
difficult that he went to seek advice and reinforcements from
his father in England.<a id="Anchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 979.">[979]</a> Geoffrey of Britanny arrived at the
same time on a like errand. Henry bade his eldest son go
to the help of the younger ones; the young king complied,<a id="Anchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 980.">[980]</a>
somewhat unwillingly, and went to collect forces in France
while Richard hurried back into Poitou. The peril was
urgent; in his absence Count Vulgrin of Angoulême had
invaded Poitou at the head of a host of Brabantines. The
invaders were however met and defeated with great slaughter
at Barbezieux by Richard’s constable Theobald Chabot and
Bishop John of Poitiers.<a id="Anchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 981.">[981]</a> By Whitsuntide Richard had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">ii.210</a></span>
gathered a sufficient force of loyal Poitevins and stipendiaries
from the neighbouring lands to march against Vulgrin
and his Brabantines and defeat them in a battle near the
border of the Angoumois and Saintonge. He then turned
upon the viscount of Limoges, besieged and took his castle
of Aixe, and thence advanced to Limoges itself, which he
captured in like manner. At midsummer he was rejoined
at Poitiers by his elder brother, and the two led their combined
forces against Vulgrin of Angoulême.<a id="Anchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 982.">[982]</a> A fortnight’s
siege had however scarcely made them masters of Châteauneuf
on the Charente when the young king—seduced, it
was said, by some evil counsellor whom we may probably
suspect to have been Bertrand de Born<a id="Anchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 983.">[983]</a>—suddenly abandoned
the campaign and withdrew again to France. Richard,
undaunted by his brother’s desertion, pushed on to Moulin-Neuf
and thence to Angoulême itself, where all the leaders
of the rebellion were gathered together. A six days’ siege
sufficed to make Vulgrin surrender himself, his fellow-rebels,
his city and five of his castles to the mercy of the duke and
the English king. Richard sent over all his prisoners to
his father in England; Henry, however, sent them back
again, and Richard put them in prison to await their
sentence till the king should return to Gaul.<a id="Anchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 984.">[984]</a></p>

<p>Northern Aquitaine, or Guyenne, was now for the
moment subdued. As soon as Christmas was over Richard
proceeded to the reduction of Gascony. Dax, held against
him by its viscount Peter and by the count of Bigorre, and
Bayonne, defended by its viscount Ernald Bertram, submitted
each after a ten days’ siege; <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Pierre-de-Cize, on
the Spanish frontier, fell in one day; the Basques and
Navarrese were compelled to promise peace; the plunderings
habitually inflicted by the border-folk upon pilgrims to the
shrine of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> James at Compostella were suppressed; and
from his court at Poitiers on Candlemas-day Richard
triumphantly reported to his father that he had pacified the
whole country.<a id="Anchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 985.">[985]</a> But the peace did not last long. Trouble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">ii.211</a></span>
was already threatening at the opposite end of the duchy.
Ralf of Déols, the wealthiest baron in Berry, had lately died
leaving as his heir an infant daughter. She was of course,
according to feudal law, a ward of her overlord, King Henry;
but her relatives seized both her and her estates, and refused
to give up either.<a id="Anchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 986.">[986]</a> Henry, probably feeling that the boy-duke
of Aquitaine had already more than enough upon his
hands, charged his eldest son with the settlement of this
affair, bidding him take possession of all Ralf’s lands without
delay, and significantly adding: “While I governed my
realms alone, I lost none of my rightful possessions; it will
be shame to us all if aught of them be lost now that we are
several to rule them.” The young king took the hint,
marched with all his Norman and Angevin forces into Berry,
and laid siege to Châteauroux;<a id="Anchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 987.">[987]</a> but he seems to have had
no success;<a id="Anchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 988.">[988]</a> and there was no chance of help from Richard,
for not only was the Limousin again plunged in civil war,<a id="Anchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 989.">[989]</a>
but all southern Aquitaine was in danger of a like fate—an
attempt of Count Raymond of Toulouse to exert his authority
as overlord of Narbonne with greater stringency than
its high-spirited viscountess Hermengard was disposed to
endure having stirred up against him a league of all the
princes of Septimania and the Spanish border, under the
leadership of Hermengard herself and of Raymond’s hereditary
rivals, the king of Aragon and his brothers.<a id="Anchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 990.">[990]</a> The way
in which Raymond prepared to meet their attack supplies a
vivid illustration of southern character and manners. He
sought an ally in Bertrand de Born, and he appealed to him
in his character not of knight but of troubadour. He sent
a messenger to Hautefort to state his cause and to ask
Bertrand, not to fight for it, but simply to publish it to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">ii.212</a></span>
world in a <i>sirvente</i>. Bertrand answered readily to the appeal;
he was only too glad of any excuse for a <i>sirvente</i>
which should “cause dints in a thousand shields, and rents
in a thousand helms and hauberks.” “I would fain have
the great barons ever wroth one with another!” is the
characteristic exclamation with which he ends his war-song.<a id="Anchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 991.">[991]</a></p>

<p>The strife thus begun for the mastery in Septimania was
continued at intervals between the houses of Toulouse and
Aragon for many years to come. The overlord of Toulouse,
however, seems to have taken no part in it as yet; and
indeed, it had scarcely more than begun when Richard was
summoned away to meet his father in Normandy. Three
times in the course of that spring and summer had King
Henry collected his host in England for the purpose of
going over sea to the help of his sons; twice had he remanded
it,<a id="Anchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 992.">[992]</a> for the sake, as it seems, of continuing his legal
and administrative work in England. By midsummer however
the tidings from Gaul were such that he dared not
further prolong his absence. Geoffrey wanted his help in
Britanny; Richard wanted it almost as much in Aquitaine;
the young king’s unaccountable lack of vigour in their support,
and in the prosecution of the war in Berry, was justly
raising suspicions of his loyalty to the family cause; and the
treaty made with Louis of France at the close of the last
war was proving, as such treaties too often did prove, only a
source of fresh disputes. Henry summoned Louis to fulfil
his part of the agreement by handing over the Vexin to the
young king and the viscounty of Bourges to Richard, according
to his promise, as the dowries of their brides;<a id="Anchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 993.">[993]</a> Louis
insisted that Henry should first complete his share of the
engagement by allowing Adela, who had been in his custody
ever since the treaty was signed, to be wedded to her
promised bridegroom, Richard. At last, in July, he succeeded
in bringing the matter to a crisis by extorting from
a papal legate who had been sent to deal with a heresy that
had arisen in southern Gaul a threat of laying all Henry’s
dominions under interdict unless Richard and Adela were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">ii.213</a></span>
married at once.<a id="Anchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 994.">[994]</a> The English bishops appealed against
the threat;<a id="Anchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 995.">[995]</a> while Henry hurried over to Normandy,<a id="Anchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 996.">[996]</a> met first
his two elder sons,<a id="Anchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 997.">[997]</a> then the legate,<a id="Anchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 998.">[998]</a> then the French king,<a id="Anchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 999.">[999]</a>
and once again contrived to stave off the threatening peril.
At Nonancourt, on September 25, the two kings made
a treaty containing not one word of marriages or dowries,
but consisting of an agreement to bury all their differences
under the cross. They pledged themselves to go on crusade
together, to submit to arbitration the questions in dispute
between them about Auvergne and Berry, and to lay aside
all their other quarrels at once and for ever.<a id="Anchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1000.">[1000]</a> Such a treaty
was in reality a mere temporary expedient; but it served
Henry’s purpose by securing him against French interference
while he marched against the rebels in Berry. As usual, he
carried all before him; Châteauroux surrendered without a
struggle; the lord of La Châtre, who had stolen the little
heiress of Déols and was keeping her fast in his own castle,
hurried to make his peace and give up his prize.<a id="Anchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1001.">[1001]</a> Henry
used his opportunity to advance into the Limousin and
exert his authority in punishing its turbulent barons;<a id="Anchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1002.">[1002]</a> soon
after Martinmas he and Louis met at Graçay and made
another ineffectual attempt to settle the vexed question of
Auvergne;<a id="Anchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1003.">[1003]</a> a month later he was again in Aquitaine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">ii.214</a></span>
purchasing the direct ownership of one of its under-fiefs,
the county of La Marche, from the childless Count Adalbert
who was purposing to end his days in Holy Land;<a id="Anchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1004.">[1004]</a> and at
Christmas he was back at Angers, where he kept the feast
with his three elder sons amid such a gathering of knights
as had never been seen at his court except at his own crowning
or that of the young king.<a id="Anchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1005.">[1005]</a></p>

The proceedings on this occasion are worth notice. Henry, it seems, tried
to substitute for the arbitration of three prelates and three laymen on each side
(which had been agreed upon at Nonancourt) his own favourite plan of sworn inquest.
He called together the barons of Auvergne, and required them to certify
what rights his predecessors the dukes of Aquitaine had enjoyed in their country.
They answered that by ancient right all Auvergne pertained to the ducal dominions,
except the bishopric (Clermont), which was dependent on the French Crown. To
this definition Louis would not agree; so they fell back upon the former scheme
of arbitration—which, however, seems never to have got any further.

(Stubbs), <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 196</cite>.
This was apparently the last meeting (except the one in

<p>For six months there was peace, and in July the king
ventured to return to England.<a id="Anchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1006.">[1006]</a> He knighted his son
Geoffrey at Woodstock on August 6,<a id="Anchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1007.">[1007]</a> and when the lad
hurried over sea, eager to flesh his maiden sword and
emulate the prowess of his brothers, he could find no more
serious field in which to exercise his warlike energies than a
succession of tournaments on the borders of France and
Normandy.<a id="Anchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1008.">[1008]</a> Richard however was again busy with more
earnest fighting. The rivalry between the houses of Aragon
and Toulouse had stirred up the petty chieftains of southern
Gascony, whom the king of Aragon was seeking to enlist in
his service; and Richard was obliged to undertake a campaign
against the count of Bigorre in particular, which seems
to have occupied him till the end of the year. The defiant
attitude of the nobles of Saintonge and the Angoumois, and
especially of a powerful baron, Geoffrey of Rancogne, called
him back at Christmas to Saintes; as soon as the feast was
over he laid siege to Geoffrey’s castle of Pons; after spending
more than three months before the place, he left his
constables to continue the blockade while he himself went to
attack the other rebel castles. Five of them were taken and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">ii.215</a></span>
razed between Easter and Rogation-tide,<a id="Anchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1009.">[1009]</a> and then Richard
gathered up all his forces to assault Geoffrey of Rancogne’s
mightiest stronghold, Taillebourg. It stood a few miles
north of Saintes, on the crest of a lofty rock, three of whose
sides were so steep as to defy any attempt to scale them,
while the fourth was guarded by a triple ditch and rampart.
Three lines of wall, built of hewn stone and strengthened
with towers and battlements, encircled the keep, which was
stored with provisions and arms offensive and defensive, and
crowded with picked men-at-arms who laughed to scorn the
rashness of the young duke in attempting to besiege a fortress
which all his predecessors had looked upon as well-nigh
unapproachable. But he cleared its approaches with a
ruthless energy such as they little expected, cutting down
vineyards, burning houses, levelling every obstacle before
him, till he pitched his tents close to the castle walls under
the eyes of the astonished townsfolk. A sally of the latter
only resulted in making a way for Richard’s entrance into
the town; three days later the castle surrendered, and
Geoffrey himself with it.<a id="Anchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1010.">[1010]</a> Ten days’ more fighting brought
all the rebels to submission and reduced Vulgrin of Angoulême
himself to give up his capital city and his castle of
Montignac in Périgord;<a id="Anchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1011.">[1011]</a> and at Whitsuntide Richard went
to report his success with his own lips to his delighted
father in England.<a id="Anchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1012.">[1012]</a></p>

<p>He returned shortly before Michaelmas,<a id="Anchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1013.">[1013]</a> to witness the
opening of a new phase in the relations between the Angevin
house and the French Crown. Philip of France, the only
son of Louis <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr>, was now fourteen years old, and his
father was desirous to have him crowned king. Before the
appointed day arrived, however, he fell sick almost to death.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">ii.216</a></span><a id="Anchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1014.">[1014]</a>
Louis, half wild with anxiety, dreamed that the martyr of
Canterbury required him to visit his shrine as a condition of
the boy’s recovery.<a id="Anchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1015.">[1015]</a> He hurried across the Channel; Henry
met him at Dover and conducted him to Canterbury, where
they both spent three days in fasting and prayer before the
shrine; and on the fourth day after his landing Louis re-entered
his own country, to find that his prayers were answered.<a id="Anchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1016.">[1016]</a>
His brief visit was long remembered in England, where no king
of France had ever been seen before,<a id="Anchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1017.">[1017]</a> or was ever seen again
save when John the Good was brought there as a prisoner in
the days of Edward <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> Scarcely, however, had Philip recovered
when Louis himself was stricken down by paralysis.<a id="Anchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1018.">[1018]</a>
This calamity made him all the more anxious for his son’s
coronation, which took place at Reims on All Saints’ day.
The archbishop of the province—a brother of Queen Adela—performed
the rite, assisted by nearly all the bishops of
Gaul; all the great vassals of the kingdom were present,
among them the young King Henry, who in his capacity of
duke of Normandy carried the crown before his youthful
overlord in the procession to and from the cathedral church,
as Count Philip of Flanders carried the sword of state.<a id="Anchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1019.">[1019]</a>
Like the crowning of young Henry himself, the crowning of
Philip Augustus proved to be a beginning of troubles. His
father’s helpless condition left the boy-king to fall under the
influence of whatever counsellor could first get at his ear. That
one happened to be his godfather, Philip of Flanders; and the
policy of Flanders was to get the boy entirely under his own
control by setting him against all his father’s old friends,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">ii.217</a></span><a id="Anchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1020.">[1020]</a>
and even against his mother, whom he tried to rob of her
dower-lands and persecuted to such a degree that she was
compelled to leave his domains and fly to her brothers
for the protection which her husband was powerless to give
her.<a id="Anchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1021.">[1021]</a> The united forces of Flanders and of the Crown—for
the latter were now wholly at Philip’s command<a id="Anchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1022.">[1022]</a>—were,
however, more than a match for those of Champagne and
Blois; and the house of Blois was driven to seek help of the
only power which seemed capable of giving it—the power
of their old rivals of Anjou.<a id="Anchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1023.">[1023]</a></p>

<p>The days were long gone by when it had been a chief
part of the Angevin interest and policy to set the French
king and the house of Blois at variance with each other. If
Henry had needed any proof that the rivalry of Blois was
no longer to be feared, he would have found it in the appeal
for succour thus sent to him by Queen Adela and her
brothers, and supported by his own eldest son, who at Mid-Lent
1180 went over to England purposely to consult with
him on the state of affairs in France. Before Easter father
and son both returned to Normandy, and there held a personal
meeting with the French queen, her brothers Theobald
of Blois and Stephen of Sancerre, and several other victims
of young Philip’s tyranny. Pledges of good faith were exchanged,
and summons were issued for a general levy of all
Henry’s forces, on both sides of the sea, ready to attack
Philip after Easter.<a id="Anchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1024.">[1024]</a> Before the attack could be made, however,
Philip had got himself into such difficulties as to render
it needless. As soon as Lent was over he went into
Flanders and there married a niece of its count, Elizabeth,
daughter of the count of Hainaut.<a id="Anchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1025.">[1025]</a> He then summoned all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">ii.218</a></span>
the princes of his realm to meet him at Sens on Whit-Sunday
for the coronation of himself and his queen. The marriage
had, however, given such offence that Philip of Flanders, in
dread of opposition to his niece’s crowning, persuaded the
young king to anticipate the ceremony and have her crowned
together with himself at <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Denis, early in the morning of
Ascension-day, by the archbishop of Sens.<a id="Anchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1026.">[1026]</a> The wrath of
the great vassals knew no bounds; and the wrath of the
archbishop of Reims was almost more formidable still, for
the exclusive right to crown the king of France was a
special prerogative of his see, and he at once forwarded to
Rome an indignant protest against the outrage done to him
by his royal nephew.<a id="Anchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1027.">[1027]</a> Philip of France and Guy of Sens
had in fact put themselves into a position which might easily
have become almost as full of peril as that into which Henry
of England and Roger of York had put themselves by a
somewhat similar proceeding ten years before. As, however,
William of Reims was not a Thomas of Canterbury, the
consequences were less tragic; and Henry himself must have
been tempted to smile at the turning of the tables which
suddenly placed in his hands the task of shielding Philip
from the consequences of his rashness, and reconciling him
to the outraged Church and the offended people.</p>

This last writer,
whose chronology has now become extremely confused, puts the event a year too
late. So does
    <cite>Rigord (Duchesne, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historia Franconum Scriptores">Hist. Franc. Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 5">vol. v.</abbr>), <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 7</cite>.
Rigord indeed
gives an account of the matter so different from that of the English writers—<i>e.g.</i>
he represents it as taking place publicly, amid a great concourse of spectators—that
one might almost suppose he was relating a second coronation, performed in
the following year. But there seems no other record of any such thing; and
there are some details in his story which point to a different conclusion. Not
only does he, too, name the archbishop of Sens as the consecrator—an outrage
upon Reims which could not possibly have been repeated—but he betrays his
own confusion by giving the date as June 1, 1181, and then describing the day as
Ascension-day, which in 1181 fell on May 14, but which really was the day of the
crowning in 1180 (May 29). The truth is that the panegyrists of Philip Augustus
are obliged to slur over this first disgraceful year of his reign as rapidly and confusedly
as they can.

<p>There was a story that young Henry of Anjou, standing
close behind his brother-in-law Philip on his first coronation-day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">ii.219</a></span>
in Reims cathedral, had bent forward to hold the crown
upon the boy’s head, and thus relieve him of its weight and
keep it safely in its place.<a id="Anchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1028.">[1028]</a> The little act of brotherly kindness
and protecting care may be taken as typical of the
political attitude which Henry’s father actually assumed
towards the boy-king of the French, and which he faithfully
maintained until Philip himself rendered its maintenance
impossible. It was in truth no new thing for a count of
Anjou to act as the protector of a king of France. But we
may fairly question whether this traditional function of the
Angevin house had ever been fulfilled so honestly and unselfishly
as it was by Henry during the first two years of
Philip’s reign. It was Henry alone who, by his personal
influence and tact, brought Philip himself to reason and the
count of Flanders to submission.<a id="Anchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1029.">[1029]</a> Next year, when Philip had
been left sole king of France by the death of Louis <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr>,<a id="Anchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1030.">[1030]</a> it
was Henry whose mediation checked an attempt of the Flemish
count to avenge by force of arms the loss of his influence at
court;<a id="Anchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1031.">[1031]</a> and when a few months later the house of Blois, with
characteristic inconstancy, made common cause with Flanders
against France, it was the prompt and vigorous action of
Henry’s sons which alone saved the royal domain from
invasion on all sides at once, and enabled their young
sovereign to hold out against his assailants till Henry himself
came over to patch up another settlement in the spring
of 1182.<a id="Anchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1032.">[1032]</a></p>

<p>Other needs, however, than those of the French Crown
were once more calling for Henry’s presence in Gaul. The
condition of Aquitaine only grew more unsatisfactory, in
spite or in consequence of Richard’s efforts to improve it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">ii.220</a></span>
Henry’s bargain with Adalbert of La Marche had failed to
secure him the possession of that county; the brother-lords
of Lusignan claimed it as next-of-kin to Adalbert as soon as
the king’s back was turned, and made good their claim by
forcible occupation.<a id="Anchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1033.">[1033]</a> The Limousin was again threatening
revolt; the town-walls of Limoges were razed by Richard’s
order at midsummer 1181.<a id="Anchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1034.">[1034]</a> Almost at the same moment
the death of Count Vulgrin of Angoulême opened a fresh
source of strife; his two brothers laid claim to his inheritance
against his only daughter, whom Richard of course took into
wardship as a feudal heiress, and on Richard’s refusal to admit
their claims they made common cause with Ademar of
Limoges.<a id="Anchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1035.">[1035]</a> The mischief however did not end here. Richard’s
unbending resolve to bridle Aquitaine had gradually stirred
up against him the bitter hatred of the whole people—a
hatred for which his stern rule is quite sufficient to account,
without admitting the blacker charges brought against him
by the reckless tongues of the south.<a id="Anchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1036.">[1036]</a> The voice of Bertrand
de Born had once more given the signal for a general
rising. A <i>sirvente</i> which went forth from Hautefort in 1181
rang like a trumpet-call in the ears of the lords of Ventadour
and Comborn and Périgord and Dax, of Angoulême
and Pons and Taillebourg.<a id="Anchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1037.">[1037]</a> But even this was not all.
Years before, it seems, there had flashed through the troubadour’s
quick brain a possibility of stirring up strife in higher
quarters than among the petty princes of his native land.
Now he distinctly saw the possibility of finding for the
Aquitanian resistance to Richard a rallying-point and a leader
in Richard’s own brother.</p>

<p>One of the most puzzling figures in the history of the
time is that of the younger Henry of Anjou—the “young
king,” as he is usually called. From the day of his crowning
to that of his death not one deed is recorded of him save<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">ii.221</a></span>
deeds of the meanest ingratitude, selfishness, cowardliness
and treachery. Yet this undutiful, rebellious son, this
corrupter and betrayer of his younger brothers, this weak
and faithless ally, was loved and admired by all men while
he lived, and lamented by all men after he was gone.<a id="Anchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1038.">[1038]</a> The
attraction exercised by him over a man so far his superior as
William the Marshal<a id="Anchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1039.">[1039]</a> is indeed well-nigh incomprehensible.
But the panegyrics of the historians, unaccountable as they
look at first glance, do throw some light on the secret of
young Henry’s gift of general fascination. It was a gift
which indeed, in varying degrees, formed part of the hereditary
endowments of the Angevin house. But the character
which it took in Fulk Nerra or Henry Fitz-Empress
was very different from that which it assumed in Henry’s
eldest son. The essence of the young king’s nature was
not Angevin. He had little either of the higher talents or
of the stronger and sterner qualities of the Angevin race; he
had still less of the characteristics of the Norman. It is by
studying his portrait as drawn in contrast to that of Richard
by a hand equally favourable to both that we can best see
what he really was. “The first was admired for his mildness
and liberality; the second was esteemed for his seriousness
and firmness. One was commendable for graciousness,
the other for stateliness. One gained praise for his courtesy,
the other for his constancy. One was conspicuous for mercy,
the other for justice. One was the refuge and the shield of
vagabonds and evil-doers, the other was their scourge. One
was devoted to the sports of war, the other to war itself;
one was gracious to strangers, the other to his own friends—one
to all men, the other only to good men.”<a id="Anchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1040.">[1040]</a> Henry in
fact was at bottom what Richard never was but on the
surface—a careless, pleasure-loving, capricious, but withal
most gracious and winning child of the south. The most
philosophic English historian of the day was reduced to
account for the young king’s popularity by the simple and
comprehensive explanation that <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">ii.222</a></span>“the number of fools is infinite.”<a id="Anchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1041.">[1041]</a>
But it was not folly, it was a shrewd perception of
their own interest, which led the Aquitanians writhing under
Richard’s iron rule to see in his elder brother a prince after
their own hearts.<a id="Anchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1042.">[1042]</a></p>

<p>It was not the first time that Bertrand de Born had
sought to kindle in the young king’s mind the sparks of
jealousy and discontent which were always latent there.<a id="Anchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1043.">[1043]</a>
Now, he fed the flames with an unsparing hand. In words
of bitter satire he ridicules the position of the young king,
who bears the titles of a great sovereign, but has no authority
in his own land, and cannot even claim the tolls upon the
traffic along its roads: “Barons of Aquitaine, are we not all
of us better than a carter who leaves his cart to go as it
may, and counts his dues, if he counts any at all, with trembling
fingers?” “I prize a tiny tract of land with honour
above a great empire with disgrace!”<a id="Anchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1044.">[1044]</a> Richard, meanwhile,
was playing into his enemies’s hands by an encroachment
upon territory which in name at least belonged to his
brother. He had built a castle at Clairvaux, between
Loudun and Poitiers, but on the Angevin side of the
frontier. If the thought of resentment did not occur to
Henry, Bertrand took care to suggest it: “Between Poitiers
and Ile-Bouchard and Mirebeau and Loudun and Chinon
some one has dared to rear, at Clairvaux, a fair castle in the
midst of the plain. I would not have the young king see
it or know of it, for it would not be to his taste; but its
walls are so white, I doubt he will catch sight of their gleam
from Mateflon!”<a id="Anchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1045.">[1045]</a> The troubadour’s shafts were well aimed,
and they rankled. When King Henry returned to Normandy
in the spring of 1182 the Aquitanian rising was in
full career; as soon as he had composed matters in France
he hurried to the help of Richard, who was fighting the
rebels in the Limousin; at Whitsuntide the counts of Angoulême<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">ii.223</a></span>
and Périgord and the viscount of Limoges came to
confer with him at Grandmont, but nothing came of the
negotiations; Henry then went to attack Pierre-Buffière,
while Richard returned to the siege of Excideuil. At midsummer
the king was back at Grandmont, and Geoffrey of
Britanny with him; thence they went to rejoin Richard,
who was now busy with the siege of Périgueux.<a id="Anchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1046.">[1046]</a> Matters
were in this stage when the young king at last made up his
mind to advance into Aquitaine. He was joyfully welcomed
at Limoges on the festival of its patron <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martial—the last
day of June. On the morrow, however, he joined his father
and brothers before Périgueux, and within a week peace was
made; Périgueux surrendered, its count and the viscount of
Limoges submitted to Richard, and only the brother-counts
of Angoulême still remained in arms against him.<a id="Anchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1047.">[1047]</a></p>

<p>Peace, however, never lasted long either in Aquitaine or
in King Henry’s family. His eldest son now again grew
importunate for a definite and immediate share in the family
heritage. When this was refused, he fled to the court of
France, and was only recalled by a promise of an increased
pecuniary allowance for himself and his queen.<a id="Anchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1048.">[1048]</a> Aquitaine,
as soon as Henry had left it, drifted into a state of anarchy
more frightful than any that had ever been known there
before; the sudden conclusion of the war had let loose all
over the country a crowd of mercenaries—commonly known
as “Brabantines,” but really the off-scouring of every land
from Flanders to Aragon—who wrought, as a local writer
says, such havoc as had never been seen since the days of
the heathen northmen.<a id="Anchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1049.">[1049]</a> The evil in some measure brought
its own remedy with it, for it drove the common people to
take into their own hands the maintenance of peace and
order. A poor Auvergnat carpenter, urged by a vision of
the Blessed Virgin, set forth under the protection of the
diocesan bishop to preach the cause of peace in his native
district of Le Puy. Those who were like-minded with him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">ii.224</a></span>
no matter what their rank or calling, enrolled themselves in
a society bound together by solemn pledges for mutual support
in adherence to right and resistance to wrong in every
shape; and in a few years these “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caputii</i>,” as they were
called from the linen capes or hoods which they always wore
in fight, proved more than a match for the Brabantines.<a id="Anchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1050.">[1050]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, the warlike barons of Aquitaine
were exasperated at the failure of their league against
Richard; and their anger reached its height when at the
conclusion of the Christmas festivities held by King Henry
and his sons at Caen, the young king of his own accord renewed
his oath of allegiance to his father, confessed his
secret alliance with Richard’s enemies, and offered to
abandon it and make peace with his brother if his father
would but insist upon the surrender of Clairvaux. Richard,
after some hesitation, gave up to his father the fortress in
dispute.<a id="Anchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1051.">[1051]</a> The incident apparently opened Henry’s eyes to
the necessity of clearly defining his sons’ political relations
with each other; and while Bertrand de Born was giving a
voice to the wrath of his fellow-barons at the young king’s
desertion of their cause,<a id="Anchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1052.">[1052]</a> Henry led his three sons back to
Angers, made them all take an oath of obedience to him
and peace with each other,<a id="Anchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1053.">[1053]</a> and then called upon the two
younger to do homage to the eldest for their fiefs.<a id="Anchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1054.">[1054]</a> Geoffrey
obeyed;<a id="Anchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1055.">[1055]</a> Richard indignantly refused, declaring it was
utterly unreasonable that there should be any distinction of
rank between children of the same parents, and that if the
father’s heritage belonged of right to the eldest son, the
mother’s was equally due to the second.<a id="Anchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1056.">[1056]</a> The young king,
on the other hand, was on account of his entanglements
with the Aquitanian barons almost as unwilling to receive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">ii.225</a></span>
the homage as Richard was to perform it.<a id="Anchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1057.">[1057]</a> The end of the
discussion was that Richard quitted the court, “leaving behind
him nothing but threats and insults,” and hurried into
Poitou to prepare for defence and defiance.<a id="Anchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1058.">[1058]</a></p>

The
two accounts do not exactly agree, Ralf placing at this point the young king’s confession
of his dealings in Aquitaine; while the story in the

<p>In the first burst of his anger Henry bade the other two
brothers go and “subdue Richard’s pride” by force of arms.<a id="Anchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1059.">[1059]</a>
Immediately afterwards, however, he summoned all three,
together with the aggrieved barons of Aquitaine, to meet
him in conference at Mirebeau.<a id="Anchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1060.">[1060]</a> But the young king had
already marched into Poitou and received a warm welcome
there;<a id="Anchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1061.">[1061]</a> Geoffrey, to whom his father had intrusted his
summons to the barons, led a motley force of Bretons, Brabantines
and mercenaries of all kinds to Limoges;<a id="Anchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1062.">[1062]</a> soon
afterwards young Henry joined him; with the viscount’s
help they threw themselves into the citadel,<a id="Anchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1063.">[1063]</a> and set to work
to raise the whole country against Richard. He, in his
extremity, appealed to his father;<a id="Anchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1064.">[1064]</a> and Henry at once
hurried to the rescue. For six weeks he laid siege to the
citadel of Limoges;<a id="Anchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1065.">[1065]</a> twice he was personally shot at, and
narrowly escaped with his life; twice the young king came
to him with offers of submission, and each time he was welcomed
with open arms, but each time the submission was a
mere feint, designed to keep Henry quiet and give the
barons time to wreak their vengeance upon Richard.<a id="Anchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1066.">[1066]</a> By
Easter matters were so far advanced that Bertrand de Born
was openly calling for aid upon Flanders, France and Normandy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">ii.226</a></span>;<a id="Anchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1067.">[1067]</a>
and the dread of a rising in this last-named
quarter prompted Henry to send orders for the arrest of
those barons, both in Normandy and England, who had
been most conspicuous in the rebellion of 1173.<a id="Anchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1068.">[1068]</a></p>

<p>The young king at the same time quitted Limoges to
make a diversion at Angoulême. On his return, however,
he found it impossible to re-enter Limoges; its townsfolk
had by this time so fully awakened to his real character and
to their own best interests that they drove him from their
walls with a volley of stones, shouting “We will not have
this man to reign over us!”<a id="Anchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1069.">[1069]</a> He had already robbed them
of their wealth and stripped the shrine of their patron saint
to provide wages for his Brabantines;<a id="Anchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1070.">[1070]</a> and the insult goaded
him to yet more unsparing plunder and yet more reckless
sacrilege. From the castle of Aixe, which he took on the
Monday in Rogation-week, he advanced to Grandmont, a
religious house whose inmates enjoyed, amid the now general
decay of monastic sanctity, an almost unique reputation for
piety and virtue, and were known to be held by his father
in especial reverence and esteem. He wrung from them all
the treasure they possessed, and forcibly carried off a golden
pyx, his father’s gift, from the high altar itself. He then
proceeded to Uzerches, where the duke of Burgundy and
the count of Toulouse met him with reinforcements on
Ascension-day; from Uzerches he moved southward to
Donzenac and Martel, and thence to Rocamadour.<a id="Anchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1071.">[1071]</a> Rocamadour
was the most famous of the holy places of Aquitaine;
besides the tomb of the hermit from whom its name was
derived, it boasted of a statue of the Virgin which attracted
as many pilgrims as the shrine of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> James at Compostella;
and among the treasures of its church, which was said to
have been founded by Zacchæus the publican, was a sword
traditionally believed to be the famous “Durandal”—the
sword of the Paladin Roland, devoted by him to the Blessed
Virgin on the eve of his last campaign, and carried to her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">ii.227</a></span>
shrine at Rocamadour after the disaster of Roncevaux. Heedless
alike of paladins and of saints, the young king stripped
the shrine of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Amadour<a id="Anchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1072.">[1072]</a> as he had stripped that of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Martial; and local tradition declares that he also carried off
the hallowed sword, leaving his own dishonoured brand in
its place.</p>

<p>He had been ailing ever since he left Uzerches;<a id="Anchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1073.">[1073]</a> now,
on his return to Martel, his baffled rage threw him into a
fever, to which other complications were soon added.<a id="Anchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1074.">[1074]</a> Conscience
awoke as death drew near. From the blacksmith’s
cottage<a id="Anchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1075.">[1075]</a> where he lay awaiting his end he sent a message to
Limoges, imploring his father to come and speak with him
once more.<a id="Anchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1076.">[1076]</a> Henry would have gone, but his friends, in their
natural dread of another trick, prevented him;<a id="Anchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1077.">[1077]</a> he sent,
however, a bishop charged with a message of love and pardon,<a id="Anchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1078.">[1078]</a>
and as a token of the genuineness of the commission, a
precious ring, said to be an heirloom from Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr><a id="Anchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1079.">[1079]</a> The
messenger was only just in time. On the Tuesday in
Whitsun-week the young king called together the bishops
and religious men who had gathered round him at the
tidings of his sickness, confessed his sins first privately, then
publicly, before all his followers, was absolved and received
the Holy Communion.<a id="Anchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1080.">[1080]</a> For three more days he lingered,
long enough to receive his father’s message of forgiveness
and to dictate a letter to him, pleading that the same
clemency might be extended to his mother the captive
Queen Eleanor, to his own young Queen Margaret, and to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">ii.228</a></span>
all his servants, friends, adherents and allies;<a id="Anchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1081.">[1081]</a> beseeching
also that his father would make atonement in his stead for
the sacrileges which he had committed against the holy
places of Aquitaine, and would cause his body to be buried
at Rouen in the cathedral church of our Lady.<a id="Anchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1082.">[1082]</a> In the
early twilight of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Barnabas’s day he repeated his confession,
after which he begged to be wrapped once more in his
cloak, marked with the cross which he had taken at Limoges
in petulance rather than in piety. Now, however, he was in
earnest, and when the sacred symbol had rested for a
moment on his shoulder he gave it to his best-beloved
knight, William the Marshal, charging him to bear it to the
Holy Sepulchre and thus fulfil his vow in his stead.<a id="Anchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1083.">[1083]</a> He
then caused his attendants to strip him of his soft raiment,
clothe him in a hair-shirt and put a rope round his neck;
with this he bade the assembled clergy drag him out of bed
and lay him on a bed of ashes strewed for the purpose.
There, lying as if already in his grave, with a stone at his
head and another at his feet, he received the last sacraments;<a id="Anchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1084.">[1084]</a>
and there, an hour after nones,<a id="Anchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1085.">[1085]</a> kissing his father’s ring he
died.<a id="Anchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1086.">[1086]</a></p>

<span class="ch2">THE LAST YEARS OF HENRY II.</span><br />

<span class="ch3">1183–1189.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> unexpected death of the young king was a catastrophe
almost equally overwhelming to both parties in the war.
Henry himself, when the news was brought to him by the
prior of Grandmont, whither the body had been taken to
be prepared for burial,<a id="Anchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1087.">[1087]</a> went almost out of his mind with
grief.<a id="Anchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1088.">[1088]</a> For a moment indeed friends and foes alike seemed
incapable of anything but mourning. Hero or saint could
scarcely have won a more universal tribute of affection and
regret than was showered upon this young king who, so far
as we can see, had done so little to deserve it. Stern voices
like that of Bertrand de Born, accustomed only to the bitterest
tones of sarcasm, insult and angry strife, melted suddenly
into accents of the deepest tenderness and lamentation.<a id="Anchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1089.">[1089]</a>
Sober-minded churchmen and worldly-wise courtiers, though
they could not deny or excuse the dead man’s sins, yet betrayed
with equal frankness their unreasoning attachment to
his memory.<a id="Anchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1090.">[1090]</a> As his body, arrayed in the linen robe which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">ii.230</a></span>
he had worn at his coronation—its white folds, hallowed by
the consecrating oil, made to serve for a winding-sheet—was
borne on an open bier upon the shoulders of his comrades-in-arms
from Grandmont northward through Anjou, the
people streamed forth from every castle and town and village
along the road to meet it with demonstrations of mourning
and tears;<a id="Anchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1091.">[1091]</a> and at Le Mans, where it was deposited for a
night in the cathedral church, the bishops and citizens forcibly
took possession of it, refused to give it up, and buried their
beloved young king then and there by the side of his grandfather
Geoffrey Plantagenet.<a id="Anchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1092.">[1092]</a>.</p>

The tone of the
real historians of the time is however somewhat different. The
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Gesta Henrici">Gesta Hen.</abbr></i></cite>
is perfectly colourless, and even on the young king’s death the writer adds not
a word of comment, good or bad. <abbr title="Roger of">Rog.</abbr> Howden, on the other hand
    <cite>(Stubbs, <abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 279)</cite>,
openly gives vent to a feeling which may be expressed by “So
perish all the enemies of King Henry,” and grows almost impatient with
Henry’s grief.

in the expression of his personal opinions, but they also appear to be somewhat
opposed to the popular sentiment. The point of view taken by
    <cite><abbr title="Gervase of Canterbury">Gerv. Cant.</abbr> (Stubbs, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 305)</cite>

<p>The political tide, however, turned as soon as he was
gone. The Aquitanian league suddenly found itself without
a head; for Geoffrey of Britanny, although the wiliest and
most plausible of all the king’s sons, was also the most
generally distrusted and disliked.<a id="Anchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1093.">[1093]</a> The league broke up at
once; on Midsummer-day Ademar of Limoges surrendered
his citadel and made his peace;<a id="Anchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1094.">[1094]</a> and most of the other
rebels soon followed his example. By the end of the month
Henry, having razed the walls of Limoges and garrisoned
with his own troops the castles which had submitted to him,
could venture to set out for Normandy;<a id="Anchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1095.">[1095]</a> while King Alfonso
of Aragon, who had come to the help of his father’s old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">ii.231</a></span>
ally, found nothing left for him to do but to join Richard in
an expedition against the one baron who still persisted in
his rebellion—Bertrand de Born.<a id="Anchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1096.">[1096]</a> If Bertrand’s story may
be believed, it was Alfonso’s treachery which, after a week’s
siege, compelled him to surrender Hautefort.<a id="Anchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1097.">[1097]</a> What followed
shewed plainly that the Aquitanian revolt was at an
end. Richard made over Hautefort to Constantine de Born,
the troubadour’s brother and lifelong rival;<a id="Anchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1098.">[1098]</a> Bertrand, instead
of calling his fellow-barons to avenge him as of old,
threw himself upon the generosity of his conqueror, and
addressed Richard in a <i>sirvente</i> entreating that his castle
might be restored to him. Richard referred him to his
father; Bertrand then hastened to the king, who greeted
him sarcastically with an allusion to one of his own earlier
<i>sirventes</i>: “You were wont to boast of possessing more
wits than you ever needed to use—what has become of
them now?” “Sire, I lost them on the day that you lost
your son.” Henry burst into tears; Bertrand was forgiven,
indemnified for the losses which he had sustained during
the siege, and dismissed with a charter securing to him from
that time forth the sole possession of Hautefort.<a id="Anchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1099.">[1099]</a> As a
natural consequence, his lyre and his sword were thenceforth
both alike at the service of the ducal house to whom he had
hitherto been such a troublesome and dangerous foe.</p>

<p>On his northward march Henry met with no opposition.
The young king had drawn to himself followers from all
parts of the Angevin dominions, as well as from those of
the French Crown;<a id="Anchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1100.">[1100]</a> but they had all been drawn by a
purely personal attraction, or by the hope of gain; their
action had no political significance; and the greater barons,
warned by their experience of ten years before, had remained
entirely aloof from the whole movement. On reaching Le
Mans, indeed, Henry found the old jealousy between Normandy
and Maine on the point of breaking out over his
son’s dead body; the clergy and people of Rouen, indignant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">ii.232</a></span>
at being defrauded of their young king’s dying bequest, were
threatening to come and destroy the city of Le Mans and
carry off his body by force. Henry was obliged to cause it
to be disinterred and conveyed to Rouen for re-burial,<a id="Anchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1101.">[1101]</a> while
he himself returned to Angers to meet Richard and to
receive Geoffrey’s submission.<a id="Anchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1102.">[1102]</a> The quarrel between the
Cenomannians and the citizens of Rouen was however only
the smallest part of the troubles which arose from the young
king’s death. As Margaret’s only child had died in infancy,
her brother Philip of France at once demanded the restoration
of her dowry, and especially the fortress of Gisors.
Henry refused to give it up; conference after conference
was held without result;<a id="Anchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1103.">[1103]</a> at last, in December, a compromise
was made, Henry consenting to do homage to Philip
for all his transmarine dominions and to pay a money-compensation
for Gisors, which was to be left in his hands
henceforth as the dowry not of Margaret, but of her sister
Adela, Richard’s affianced bride.<a id="Anchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1104.">[1104]</a></p>

According
to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta</i>, one of Henry’s contrivances for avoiding the restitution of the
dower-lands was to declare that he had bestowed them upon his own wife; and
he set her at liberty and made her go through the said lands to demonstrate the
fact. If so, however, she was soon put in prison again.

<p>But a far worse difficulty remained. All Henry’s schemes
for the distribution of his territories were upset by the death
of his heir, and it was necessary to devise some new arrangement.
It really seems as if Henry’s first thought about the
matter was that now at last he could provide as he chose
for his darling “Lackland”; for he at once bade the English
justiciar Ralf de Glanville bring John over to meet him in
Normandy. As soon as they arrived he sent for Richard and
unfolded his plan. Richard was now the eldest son; if he
lived, he must in due time succeed his father as head of the
Angevin house. Henry had clearly no mind to venture a
second time upon the dangerous experiment of crowning his
heir during his own life. But, although we have no actual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">ii.233</a></span>
statement of his intentions, it seems plain that he did intend
to place Richard, in every respect short of the coronation, in
the same position which had been held by the young king.
Under these circumstances, if the continental dominions of
the Angevin house were to be redistributed among the three
surviving brothers, there was only one possible mode of redistribution.
Geoffrey could not give up Britanny, for he
was now actually married to its duchess;<a id="Anchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1105.">[1105]</a> but Richard, in
consideration of his prospects as future king of England,
duke of Normandy and count of Anjou, might fairly be
asked to surrender to his youngest brother the duchy of
Aquitaine. So at least it seemed from Henry’s point of
view. Richard however saw the matter in another light.
Not because he loved Aquitaine, but because he hated it—because
for eight years he had fought unceasingly to crush it
beneath his feet—now that it lay there prostrate, he could
not let it escape him. Richard was generous; but to give
up to other hands the reaping of a harvest which he had
sown with such unsparing labour and watered with such
streams of blood, was a sacrifice too great for his generosity
in his six-and-twentieth year. He met his father’s demand
with a request for time to think it over; that evening he
mounted his horse and rode straight for Poitou; and thence
he sent back a message that so long as he lived, no one but
himself should ever hold the duchy of Aquitaine.<a id="Anchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1106.">[1106]</a></p>

<p>After threatening and beseeching him by turns all
through the winter, Henry so far lost patience that he gave

<p>Meanwhile the king himself was again called over sea
by fresh troubles in Gaul. The king of France and the
count of Flanders had been quarrelling for the last two years
over the territories of the latter’s deceased wife, the counties
of Amiens and Vermandois;<a id="Anchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1115.">[1115]</a> Henry’s last act before he left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">ii.235</a></span>
Normandy had been to arrange a truce between them.<a id="Anchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1116.">[1116]</a> Two
months later—in August 1184—while Philip of Flanders
was away in England on a pilgrimage to the martyr’s tomb
at Canterbury, Philip of France broke the truce by stirring
up his father-in-law the count of Hainaut to attack Flanders
in his behalf: Philip of Flanders appealed for help to his
other overlord the Emperor Frederic; the archbishop of
Cöln, who had been his fellow-pilgrim, at once joined him in
a counter-invasion of Hainaut;<a id="Anchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1117.">[1117]</a> and the incalculable dangers
of a war between France and Germany were only averted by
Frederic’s wise reluctance to interfere, strengthened, we may
perhaps suspect, by the influence of the English king. It
seemed indeed as if nothing but Henry’s presence could
avail to keep order in Gaul. When he returned thither, in
April 1185,<a id="Anchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1118.">[1118]</a> his first task was to pacify another quarrel
between his own sons. This time the elder one seems to
have been the aggressor; and Henry grew so angry that he
once more summoned Richard to give up Aquitaine altogether,
not, however, to either of his brothers, but to its own
lawful lady, his mother, Queen Eleanor. Despite all her
faults, Eleanor was reverenced by her sons; Richard especially
treated her throughout his life with the utmost respect and
affection; and the demand thus made in her behalf met
with immediate submission.<a id="Anchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1119.">[1119]</a> For nine months Henry’s
dominions were quiet, and his hands were free to deal with
the quarrels of France and Flanders. But before he had
succeeded in pacifying them, a further complication was
added. King Bela of Hungary made suit to Philip of
France for the hand of his sister the widowed Queen
Margaret,<a id="Anchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1120.">[1120]</a> and this at once re-opened the question about her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">ii.236</a></span>
dower; for the agreement made two years before had been
conditional upon Richard’s marriage with Adela, and as this
event seemed as far off as ever, Philip again laid claim to
the whole dowry, including Gisors. He was however too
much in need of Henry’s assistance in his dispute with
Flanders over the dower-lands of Isabel of Vermandois to
risk a quarrel with him about those of the young queen;
and by Henry’s tact and diplomacy both questions were
settled in a conference at Gisors itself early in 1186.<a id="Anchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1121.">[1121]</a> The
count of Flanders gave up Vermandois to Philip Augustus,<a id="Anchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1122.">[1122]</a>
while Philip and Margaret again consented, in return for a
money-compensation from Henry, to make Gisors over to
him on the old condition—that Richard should marry Adela
without further delay.<a id="Anchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1123.">[1123]</a> The condition however remained
unfulfilled. Richard was again despatched into Aquitaine,
not indeed as its duke—for Henry had placed all its fortresses
under officers of his own appointment<a id="Anchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1124.">[1124]</a>—but still as
his father’s representative, charged in his name with the
maintenance of obedience and order.<a id="Anchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1125.">[1125]</a> As for Eleanor,
Henry had clearly never intended again to intrust her with
any real authority; and in April he carried her back with
him to England.<a id="Anchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1126.">[1126]</a></p>

This last version is extremely confused in its chronology. The main
facts of the case are these: Philip of Flanders and Isabel his wife had no children,
and they had quarrelled
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Gesta Henrici">Gesta Hen.</abbr></i> as above, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 99, 100</cite>).
Philip’s heir-presumptive
was his sister Margaret, wife of Count Baldwin of Hainaut, and after her,
her son, another Baldwin. In 1180, however, Philip proposed, instead of leaving
all his dominions to his sister and her son, to settle the southern half of them,
comprising Vermandois and Flanders south of the river Lys, upon her daughter
Elizabeth, whom he had just given in marriage to Philip of France.
    (<cite><i><abbr title="Ibid.">Ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 245.</cite>)
He meant to leave them to her on his own death; but when his wife died, in 1182
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 285</cite>),
Philip Augustus laid claim to her two counties as lapsed fiefs. King
and count went on quarrelling till 1186, when, as we shall see, the matter was
settled by the immediate cession of Vermandois to Philip Augustus, who thereupon
agreed to wait for the rest till the Flemish count’s death.

<p>England was now his only refuge. In these closing
years of his reign, when the whole interest of the story
centres round the person of the king, the character of those
few incidents which take place on English ground is in
striking contrast with the state of affairs which occupied him
in Gaul. While the Angevin dominions on the continent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">ii.237</a></span>
were threatening disruption under their owner’s very eyes,
each of his visits to England was marked by some fresh
indication of the firm hold which he had gained upon his
island realm and its dependencies, or of the lofty position
which England under him had acquired among the powers
of the world. Of the internal affairs of England itself,
indeed, we hear absolutely nothing save a few ecclesiastical
details, and of Wales and Scotland scarcely more. Henry’s
first business after his landing in 1184 had been to lead
an army against South Wales;<a id="Anchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1127.">[1127]</a> but at the mere tidings of
his approach Rees hurried to make submission at Worcester.<a id="Anchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1128.">[1128]</a>
William of Scotland was in still greater haste to meet the
English king with a suit for the hand of his granddaughter
Matilda of Saxony,<a id="Anchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1129.">[1129]</a> who was now in England with her
parents. The project was foiled by the Pope’s refusal to
grant a dispensation,<a id="Anchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1130.">[1130]</a> without which such a marriage was
impossible, owing to the descent of both parties from
Malcolm <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> and Margaret. Henry, however, on his
next visit to England in 1186, proposed that William
should wed in Matilda’s place her kinswoman Hermengard
of Beaumont.<a id="Anchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1131.">[1131]</a> Hermengard stood even nearer than Matilda
in descent from Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, but there was no obstacle to
her marriage with the king of Scots; he therefore willingly
embraced the offer; and before the year closed the
alliance between the two kings was doubly cemented, first
at Carlisle by the final submission of Galloway to Henry,
William himself standing surety for its obedience;<a id="Anchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1132.">[1132]</a> and
afterwards, at Woodstock on September 5, by the marriage
of Hermengard and William, to whom Henry restored
Edinburgh castle as his contribution to the dowry of the
bride.<a id="Anchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1133.">[1133]</a></p>

<p>Henry is said to have received in the course of the
same year another proposal, from a more distant quarter, for
his granddaughter’s hand. According to one writer, Bela of
Hungary had at first desired the young Saxon princess for his
queen, and it was only Henry’s long delay in answering his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">ii.238</a></span>
suit which provoked him to transfer it to Margaret.<a id="Anchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1134.">[1134]</a> Both
Matilda’s suitors must have been attracted solely by the
ambition of forming a family connexion with her grandfather
King Henry; and that attraction must have been a
very strong one, for at the time of William’s suit, if not at
the time of Bela’s, it had to counterbalance the fact that
Matilda herself, her parents, and all their other children,
were landless and penniless exiles. To Henry’s load of
family cares there had been added since 1180 that of the
troubles of his eldest daughter and her husband, Duke Henry
the Lion of Saxony. During the retreat of the Imperial
forces from Italy in 1179 the duke fell under the displeasure
of his cousin the Emperor; next year he was deprived of
all his estates and placed under the ban of the Empire. In
the summer of 1182 he and his family made their way to
the sole refuge left them, the court of his father-in-law; and
there for the most part they remained during the next two
years. Towards the close of 1184 the English king’s influence
in Germany prevailed to obtain the duke’s restoration
to his patrimonial duchy of Brunswick;<a id="Anchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1135.">[1135]</a> and another token
of the eagerness with which Henry’s alliance was sought
may be seen in the fact that among the conditions demanded
by Frederic was the betrothal of one of his own daughters
to Richard of Poitou.<a id="Anchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1136.">[1136]</a> This condition, which might have
added considerably to Henry’s difficulties in France, was
annulled by the speedy death of the intended bride.<a id="Anchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1137.">[1137]</a> On
the other hand, the restoration of the exiled duke was far
from complete; Brunswick was only a small part of the
vast territories which he had formerly possessed; although
he returned to Germany in 1185,<a id="Anchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1138.">[1138]</a> it was as a suspected and
ruined man; and before Henry’s reign closed another sentence
of banishment drove him and his wife again to seek
the shelter of her father’s court.</p>

<p>Early in 1185 came a crowning proof of the estimation
in which the English king was held both at home and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">ii.239</a></span>
abroad. King Baldwin <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> of Jerusalem, the eldest son and
successor of Queen Melisenda and Fulk of Anjou, had died
in 1162, the year of Thomas Becket’s appointment to the
see of Canterbury. He was succeeded by his brother
Almeric, who died while Henry was struggling with his
rebellious barons in 1173. During the twelve years which
had passed since then, Almeric’s son, another Baldwin, had
fought on bravely against overwhelming odds to keep out
the Infidel foe. But the struggle grew more hopeless year
by year and day by day. The young king himself was in
natural temper as gallant a knight as ever sprang from the
blood of Anjou; but he was crippled physically, socially and
politically by a disease which made his life a burthen—he
was a leper; his kingdom was torn by the mutual jealousies
of the kinsmen on whom he was compelled to rely for its
government and defence; while the political and military
power of the Turks was growing to a height such as it had
never before attained, under their famous leader Saladin.<a id="Anchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1139.">[1139]</a>
If the necessities of Palestine had been grievous when King
Baldwin <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> had called upon Fulk to protect Melisenda on
her perilous throne—if they had been grievous when Melisenda
sought the aid of the western princes for her infant
son Baldwin <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>—they were far more grievous now. But
times were changed in the west since Melisenda had been
obliged to rest content with a general appeal addressed to
Latin Christendom through the abbot of Clairvaux. Independent
of the claim of the king of Jerusalem to the sympathy
and the succour of all Christian princes, Baldwin had
a direct personal claim upon one prince, and that one well-nigh
the mightiest of all. He himself represented one
branch of the race whose power had spread from the black
rock of Angers to the ends of the earth; the other, the elder
branch, was represented by Henry Fitz-Empress. As Baldwin’s
nearest kinsman, as the foremost descendant alike of
Fulk the King and of Fulk the Canon, as head of the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">ii.240</a></span>
Angevin race on both sides of the sea, it was to the Angevin
king of England that the Angevin king of Jerusalem
appealed, as a matter of right and almost of duty, for succour
in his extremity.<a id="Anchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1140.">[1140]</a> And he threw his appeal into a shape
which made it indeed irresistible. Henry was at Nottingham,
on his way northward to York, in the last days of
January 1185, when he was stopped by tidings that two of
the highest dignitaries of the Latin Church in the east,
Heraclius the Patriarch of Jerusalem and the Grand Master
of the Hospital, had arrived at Canterbury on a mission from
Holy Land.<a id="Anchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1141.">[1141]</a> He at once changed his course and hurried
southward again to meet them at Reading.<a id="Anchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1142.">[1142]</a> With a burst
of tears Heraclius laid at the feet of the English king the
royal standard of Jerusalem, the keys of the city, those of
the Tower of David and of the Holy Sepulchre itself, beseeching
him in Baldwin’s name to carry them back at the
head of his crusading host.</p>

<p>The whole assembly wept with the Patriarch; and the
king himself was deeply moved.<a id="Anchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1143.">[1143]</a> How many of his earlier
projects of going on crusade—now to Spain, now to Holy
Land, now alone, now with the king of France—had been
mere political expedients, we cannot tell; there may have
been more sincerity in them than one is at first disposed to
imagine. Little as Henry cared for either war or adventure
merely for its own sake, still there flowed in his veins, no
less than in those of his young cousin Baldwin, the blood of
Angevin pilgrims and crusaders. The lifelong dream of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">ii.241</a></span>
Fulk Nerra and Fulk <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr> may have been also the dream of
Henry, although none of the three was a man to let his
dreams influence his conduct until he saw a clear possibility
of realizing them. Whether there was such a possibility
now, however, was a question whose decision did not rest
with Henry alone. If he was to head a crusade, he must
head it not merely as count of Anjou but as king of
England, with all England’s powers and resources, material
and moral, at his back; and this could only be if England
sanctioned his undertaking. The “faithful men of the
land”—the bishops and barons, the constitutional representatives
of the nation—were therefore gathered together
in council at Clerkenwell on March 18; Henry bade them
advise him as they thought best for his soul’s health, and
promised to abide by their decision. After deliberation,
they gave it as their unanimous judgement that he must
remain at home and not venture to abandon, for the sake of
giving his personal assistance in the east, the work to which
he was pledged by his coronation-oath, of keeping his own
realms in peace and order and securing them from external
foes.<a id="Anchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1144.">[1144]</a> Whether or not the decision thus arrived at was wise
for the interests of Christendom at large—whether or not it
redounds altogether to the honour of England—it was surely
the highest tribute she could pay to her Angevin king. A
ruler from whom his people were so unwilling to part had
clearly some better hold over them than that of mere
force. That they shrank with such dread from any interruption
of his kingly labours is the best proof how greatly
they had benefited by those labours during the past thirty
years.</p>

<p>The Patriarch was bitterly disappointed, and vented his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">ii.242</a></span>
disappointment upon Henry in unmeasured terms. In vain
did he intreat that at least John, the only one of the king’s
sons then in England, might be sent to infuse some new
life into the rapidly-dying stock of the Angevin house in
Palestine. John himself, it is said, was eager to go,<a id="Anchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1145.">[1145]</a> but
the king refused his consent, and six weeks later, as we
have seen, despatched him as governor to Ireland. This
mission failed completely, through John’s own fault. He
was received with every demonstration of loyalty both by
the native princes and by the English settlers; but in a
very few months he contrived to set them all against him.
He treated the English leaders with the most overbearing
insolence; he insulted the Irish chieftains who came to
bring him their loyal greetings at Waterford more brutally
still, mocking at their dress and manners, and even pulling
their beards;<a id="Anchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1146.">[1146]</a> he sent the mercenaries who had accompanied
him from England to make a raid upon North Munster, in
which they were repulsed with great loss,<a id="Anchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1147.">[1147]</a> and then exasperated
them to mutiny by keeping them penniless while
he spent their wages upon his own pleasure.<a id="Anchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1148.">[1148]</a> By September
he had brought matters to such a pass that his father was
obliged to recall him and bid John de Courcy undertake the
government of Ireland in his place.<a id="Anchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1149.">[1149]</a> Henry however was
far from abandoning his cherished scheme. Blinded by his
fatal partiality for his youngest child, he was willing to attribute
John’s failure to any cause except the true one; he
determined that the lad should return to his post, but
clothed with fuller powers and loftier dignity. Taking advantage
of a change in the Papacy, he at once applied to
the new Pope, Urban <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>, for leave to have his son anointed
and crowned as king of Ireland. Urban not only gave his
consent, but accompanied it with a gift of a crown made of
peacock’s feathers set in gold.<a id="Anchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1150.">[1150]</a> Next summer there came
to England news that <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">ii.243</a></span>“a certain Irishman had cut off the
head of Hugh de Lacy”;<a id="Anchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1151.">[1151]</a> Henry, seeing in this event an
opportunity of recovering for the Crown Hugh’s vast estates
in Ireland, hurried John off thither at once<a id="Anchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1152.">[1152]</a> without waiting
to have him crowned, or possibly intending that the coronation
should take place in Dublin. But before John had
sailed, he was recalled by tidings of another death which
touched his father more nearly.</p>

to withdraw from them his homage for Britanny and become
Philip’s liegeman, receiving in return the title of grand
seneschal which in the year of his own birth had been
conferred upon his father as a warrant for intervention in
the affairs of the Breton duchy.<a id="Anchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1155.">[1155]</a> Faithful servants of the
English king were inclined to see in Geoffrey’s sudden end
a divine judgement upon this undutiful scheme.<a id="Anchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1156.">[1156]</a> Philip however
saw a means of making his own profit out of Geoffrey’s
death, quite as readily as out of his life. He at once
claimed, as overlord, the wardship of the infant heiress-presumptive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">ii.244</a></span>
of Britanny—Eleanor, the only child of
Geoffrey and Constance<a id="Anchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1157.">[1157]</a>—and with it the administration
of her duchy till she should be old enough to be married.
Henry tried to temporize,<a id="Anchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1158.">[1158]</a> but the longer the negotiations
lasted the more complicated they became, as Philip kept
increasing his demands. First Aquitaine was dragged into
the dispute. Its northern portion was just now in a state
of unwonted tranquillity, for at the close of the year we
find Bertrand de Born complaining that he had witnessed
neither siege nor battle for more than twelve months.<a id="Anchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1159.">[1159]</a>
Richard was in fact busy in the south, at war with the
count of Toulouse.<a id="Anchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1160.">[1160]</a> Against this Philip remonstrated, as
an unjust aggression upon a loyal vassal of the French
Crown;<a id="Anchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1161.">[1161]</a> he added to his remonstrance a demand for
Richard’s homage to himself for Aquitaine, and also—all
prospect of Adela’s marriage being now apparently at an
end—for the definite restitution of Gisors.<a id="Anchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1162.">[1162]</a> While the two
kings were negotiating, actual hostilities broke out between
some of their constables on the border; the warlike zeal
of both parties, however, died down at the approach of
Christmas;<a id="Anchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1163.">[1163]</a> Henry lingered in England to receive two
papal legates who were coming to crown John as king of
Ireland,<a id="Anchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1164.">[1164]</a> but the crowning never took place; and at last, on
February 17, 1187, king and legates sailed together for
Normandy.<a id="Anchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1165.">[1165]</a></p>

<p>When the two kings met at the Gué-<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Rémy on April
5,<a id="Anchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1166.">[1166]</a> little Eleanor was no longer heiress of Britanny. On<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">ii.245</a></span>
Easter-day Constance had become the mother of a son,
whom the Bretons, in defiance of his grandfather’s wish to
bestow upon him his own name, insisted upon calling after
the legendary hero of their race, Arthur<a id="Anchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1167.">[1167]</a>—thus at once
claiming him as the representative of their national existence
and rights. The child’s birth made little difference in
the political situation; Philip claimed the wardship of the
heir of Britanny just as he had claimed that of its heiress;
the conference broke up, and both parties prepared for war.
Henry distributed his forces in four divisions; one of these
was commanded by his eldest son, Geoffrey the chancellor,
who as bishop-elect of Lincoln had given good proof of his
military capacities in the revolt of 1174;—another was
intrusted to the king’s faithful friend Earl William de Mandeville;
the other two were commanded respectively by
Richard and John, and it seems that both of these were at
once sent down into Berry, where Philip was expected to
begin his attack. Soon after Whitsuntide Philip advanced
upon Berry,<a id="Anchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1168.">[1168]</a> took Issoudun and Graçay, and laid siege to
Châteauroux.<a id="Anchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1169.">[1169]</a> Henry now followed his sons; the three
together marched to the relief of Châteauroux, and Richard
apparently succeeded in making his way into the place,
where John afterwards rejoined him.<a id="Anchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1170.">[1170]</a> For nearly a fortnight
the two kings remained encamped on opposite sides
of the Indre, drawing up their forces every morning for
battle;<a id="Anchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1171.">[1171]</a> but each day the battle was averted by some
means or other. Now it was the mediation of the French
bishops in Philip’s camp, or of the Roman legates in that
of Henry;<a id="Anchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1172.">[1172]</a> now it was a miraculous judgement upon a
sacrilegious Brabantine in the French host, which scared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">ii.246</a></span>
Philip into dismissing his mercenaries;<a id="Anchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1173.">[1173]</a> now it was the
count of Flanders who, as soon as his peace with France
was made, turned against the peace-maker and sought to
stir Richard up to play over again the part of the young
king; now it was Henry himself who opened negotiations
for a truce.<a id="Anchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1174.">[1174]</a> Finally, on Midsummer-eve,<a id="Anchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1175.">[1175]</a> a truce was
made for two years.<a id="Anchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1176.">[1176]</a> According to Bertrand de Born, it
was wrung from Philip by the discovery that the troops of
Champagne, which formed a considerable part of his army,
had been bought over by the English king.<a id="Anchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1177.">[1177]</a> Its actual
negotiator was Richard;<a id="Anchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1178.">[1178]</a> and when Richard, instead of
returning to his father, rode away in the closest companionship
with the king of France, Henry naturally grew suspicious
of the terms on which it had been won. His
suspicions were confirmed when Richard, under pretence of
obeying his summons to return, made his way to Chinon
and there seized the contents of the Angevin treasury,
which he immediately applied to the fortification of his
own castles in Poitou.<a id="Anchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1179.">[1179]</a> A partizan of Richard tells us
that Philip had communicated to him a letter in which
Henry proposed to make peace by marrying Adela to
John and constituting the latter heir to all his dominions
except England and Normandy.<a id="Anchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1180.">[1180]</a> If this scheme really
existed, it was foiled by Philip’s own act; and when Henry
and his elder son met soon afterwards at Angers, their differences<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">ii.247</a></span>
were apparently settled for the moment by Richard’s
reinstatement in the dukedom of Aquitaine; for we are told
that he not only returned to his duty, but publicly renewed
his homage to the king.<a id="Anchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1181.">[1181]</a></p>

turns the truce into an abject submission of Henry
and Richard. Gerald says that one of the conditions of the truce was that
Auvergne, which Philip had conquered, should remain in his hands during the
period. But none of the other authorities mention Auvergne at all at this time;
and Gerald’s statement seems incompatible with the French accounts of Philip’s
attack upon Auvergne, as if upon a hostile country, in 1188
    (<cite>Rigord, as above,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 27</cite>;
    <cite><abbr title="William of Armorica">Will. Armor.</abbr>, <i>ibid.</i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 74, 122</cite>).
Gerald and Rigord are however almost equally untrustworthy for details, and especially for chronology.

<p>All these western quarrels again sank into the background
before the tidings which came from Holy Land as
the year drew to a close. Heraclius had gone home from
his unsuccessful mission to find Baldwin <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr> delivered out
of all his troubles, and his throne occupied by his infant
nephew, the child of his sister Sibyl. The little king
soon followed his uncle to the grave; and Sibyl, on whom
the representation of the royal house thus devolved, at once
bestowed her crown upon the man who had already been for
six years the bravest and most successful defender of the
distracted realm—her husband, Guy of Lusignan.<a id="Anchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1182.">[1182]</a> Guy
sprang from a faithless race whom the Angevins had little
cause to love or trust in their western home; but in Palestine
he was hated simply because he had deservedly won the
affection and the confidence of both Baldwin and Sibyl.
Thwarted, baffled, deserted, betrayed by envious rivals, left
almost alone to face the Infidel foes whose advance grew
more threatening day by day, Guy fought on till in a great
battle at Tiberias, in July 1187, he was made prisoner by
the Turks; the Christians were totally defeated, and the
relic of the Cross, which they had carried with them to the
fight, fell with the king into the hands of the unbelievers.<a id="Anchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1183.">[1183]</a>
The tidings of this disaster, when they reached Europe in
October, gave the death-blow to Pope Urban <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr><a id="Anchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1184.">[1184]</a> His
successor, Gregory <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr>, opened his pontificate with an impassioned
appeal to all Western Christendom for the rescue
of the Holy Land.<a id="Anchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1185.">[1185]</a> The first response came from the young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">ii.248</a></span>
duke of Aquitaine; without waiting to consult his father, at
the earliest tidings of the catastrophe Richard took the
cross at the hands of the archbishop of Tours.<a id="Anchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1186.">[1186]</a> Henry
himself was so thunderstruck at the news that for four days
he suspended all state business and refused to see any one.<a id="Anchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1187.">[1187]</a>
He was in Normandy, and with him was Archbishop Baldwin
of Canterbury, who had taken the cross two years before
with the archbishop of Rouen, the veteran warrior-bishop
Hugh of Durham, the justiciar Ralf de Glanville, and a crowd
of other dignitaries of both Church and state, none of whom,
however, had as yet actually started on their crusade. It
was not King Henry who hindered them; he had given
every facility for the preaching of the crusade throughout
his dominions;<a id="Anchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1188.">[1188]</a> and even in Richard’s case, although
reproving the hastiness of the vow, he made no attempt to
thwart its fulfilment, but on the contrary promised his son
every assistance in his power.<a id="Anchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1189.">[1189]</a> Richard’s project, however,
roused up the king of France to insist once more upon his
immediate marriage with Adela, or, failing this, the restitution
of Gisors; and Henry, on his way to England in
January 1188, was recalled by tidings that Philip had
gathered his host and was threatening to invade Normandy
unless his demands were granted at once. The kings met
at the old trysting-place between Gisors and Trie;<a id="Anchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1190.">[1190]</a> but
their conference had scarcely begun when it was interrupted
by another messenger from Palestine, charged with news of
a catastrophe more awful than even that of Tiberias. Three
months after Guy’s capture, in October 1187, Jerusalem
itself had fallen into the hands of the Infidels;<a id="Anchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1191.">[1191]</a> and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">ii.249</a></span>
archbishop of Tyre now came to tell with his own lips the
sad and shameful story.</p>

<p>In his presence the selfish quarrel of the two kings was
shamed into silence. The king of France took the cross at
once, and the king of England followed his example, this
time without waiting for his people’s consent; the archbishops
of Reims and Rouen, the counts of Flanders,
Burgundy, Blois and Champagne, and a crowd of French
and Norman barons did the like.<a id="Anchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1192.">[1192]</a> The two kings set up a
wooden cross, afterwards replaced by a church, to mark the
spot, which they called the “Holy Field”;<a id="Anchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1193.">[1193]</a> then they
separated to make their preparations. Henry at once sent
to request a safe-conduct for himself and his troops through
the dominions of the king of Hungary and those of the
Western and Eastern Emperors.<a id="Anchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1194.">[1194]</a> Before the end of the
month he issued from Le Mans an ordinance known as that of
the “Saladin tithe,” requiring every man in his dominions
to give towards the expenses of the crusade a tithe of all his
personal property, excepting only the necessary outfit of a
knight or a priest.<a id="Anchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1195.">[1195]</a> This was accompanied by eight other
ordinances also relating to the crusade,<a id="Anchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1196.">[1196]</a> and was imitated
two months later in France by Philip Augustus.<a id="Anchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1197.">[1197]</a> On January
30 Henry returned to England;<a id="Anchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1198.">[1198]</a> on February 11 he met
the bishops and barons in council at Geddington near
Northampton, to obtain their assent to the Saladin tithe and
make arrangements for its collection.<a id="Anchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1199.">[1199]</a> It was chiefly to superintend
this that the king remained in England, while the archbishop
of Canterbury went to preach the crusade in Wales.<a id="Anchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1200.">[1200]</a></p>

Henry seems to have intended going to Wales himself, but to have given it
up and sent the archbishop instead—an exchange which Baldwin gladly accepted,
as he was at feud with his chapter, and greatly relieved to get away from it.

<p>Meanwhile Richard was eager to start without delay;
but his father refused his consent, insisting that their expedition
should be made in common. The impatient “Lion-heart,”
however, was not to be thus restrained, and in his
father’s absence he made all his preparations and wrote to
bespeak the aid of his brother-in-law William of Sicily for
the voyage which he was determined to begin as soon as the
summer should arrive.<a id="Anchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1201.">[1201]</a> But his plans were checked by a
fresh rising of the Poitevin barons, headed as usual by the
count of Angoulême, Geoffrey of Rancogne and Geoffrey
of Lusignan.<a id="Anchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1202.">[1202]</a> This last was the worst offender, having
treacherously slain a personal friend of Richard’s.<a id="Anchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1203.">[1203]</a> But, like
Richard himself, he had taken the cross; and it was doubtless
owing to this protection that, before the summer was
over, he was suffered to make his escape to the realm of his
hapless brother in Palestine.<a id="Anchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1204.">[1204]</a> The other rebels were scarcely
put down when Raymond of Toulouse seized and cruelly
maltreated some Poitevin merchants who were passing
through his territory. Richard at once avenged this outrage
by an armed raid upon the frontier-districts of Toulouse, and
presently managed to catch and imprison the count’s chief
adviser Peter Seilun, who was said to have instigated the
seizure of the merchants. Raymond retaliated by capturing
two knights attached to the household of the English king,
Robert Poer and Ralf Fraser, on their way back from a
pilgrimage to Compostella; and neither Richard’s protest
against the sacrilege of keeping pilgrims in prison, nor even
the express command of the king of France for their liberation
out of reverence to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> James, could induce him to give
them up on any condition save the release of Peter Seilun,
which Richard firmly refused.<a id="Anchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1205.">[1205]</a> A heavy ransom offered by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">ii.251</a></span>
the two English captives themselves shortly afterwards
changed Raymond’s determination;<a id="Anchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1206.">[1206]</a> but this was of course
no satisfaction to Richard, and after Whitsuntide he again
invaded Toulouse with fire and sword; castle after castle
fell into his hands, till at last he began to threaten the capital
itself.<a id="Anchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1207.">[1207]</a></p>

This last writer says that Richard took seventeen castles, but he must be counting in
those which had been taken in the spring. The date of this second expedition
comes from
    <cite>Rigord (Duchesne, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historia Franconum Scriptores">Hist. Franc. Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 5">vol. v.</abbr>), <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 27</cite>,
who places
it between Pentecost and midsummer. The new editors of
    <cite>Vic and Vaissète, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire">Hist.</abbr> du Languedoc</i>, <abbr title="volume 7">vol. vii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 22</cite>,
charge Rigord with false chronology here, and
insist upon following (as they suppose) that of <abbr title="William of Armorica">Will. Armor.</abbr>, who tells us that
Richard began his campaign against Toulouse “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modico elapso tempore</span>” after
the Mid-Lenten council at Paris
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta <abbr title="Philippi Augusti">Phil. Aug.</abbr></i>, Duchesne, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historia Franconum Scriptores">Hist. Franc. Scriptt.</abbr></i>,
<abbr title="volume 5">vol. v.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 74</cite>).
If, however, they had read the English authorities more carefully,
they would have seen that there were really two campaigns, and that while <abbr title="William of Armorica">Will.
Armor.</abbr> speaks of the first, Rigord is speaking of the second.

<p>In Aquitaine even more than elsewhere, the beginning
of strife was like the letting-out of water. This time the
strife of Richard and Raymond led to the outbursting of a
flood which ended by overspreading the whole Angevin
dominions and sweeping away Henry Fitz-Empress himself.
If Richard’s story was true, neither he nor Raymond was
the real originator of the mischief; it was Philip of France
who had secretly urged him to the attack;<a id="Anchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1208.">[1208]</a> while another
rumour, which Richard was only too ready to believe,
accused Henry himself of stirring up the count of Toulouse
and the Aquitanian rebels against his son, in order to prevent
him from starting on the Crusade.<a id="Anchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1209.">[1209]</a> Little as we can credit
such a tale, it is easy to imagine how dexterously Philip
would use it to sow dissensions between father and son and
entangle the impetuous Richard in a coil such as only the
sword could cut. Openly, meanwhile, Philip was taking the
part of Toulouse, and peremptorily insisting that Henry
should put a stop to his son’s aggressions in that quarter.<a id="Anchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1210.">[1210]</a>
Without waiting for Henry’s reply, he marched upon Berry
and laid siege to Châteauroux, which surrendered to him on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">ii.252</a></span>
June 16.<a id="Anchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1211.">[1211]</a> It was now Henry’s turn to remonstrate against
this breach of truce, all the more flagrant because committed
against a brother-crusader. He knew however that nothing
but his own presence could make his remonstrances of any
avail; sending John over before him, on the night of July
10 he hurried across the sea to Barfleur, and thence went
to muster his forces at Alençon.<a id="Anchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1212.">[1212]</a> They consisted of the
feudal levies of England and Normandy, and a multitude of
Welsh under the command of Ralf de Glanville,<a id="Anchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1213.">[1213]</a> together
with some Bretons and Flemish mercenaries,<a id="Anchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1214.">[1214]</a> and apparently
some Angevins and Cenomannians.<a id="Anchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1215.">[1215]</a> Henry was however
very unwilling to resort to force; his old scruple about
making war upon his overlord seems not to have been yet
quite extinguished, and moreover he shrank alike from the
bloodshed and the expense of war. During some weeks his
forces were still kept idle, save for an occasional plundering-raid
across the French border.<a id="Anchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1216.">[1216]</a> Philip meanwhile was
carrying all before him in Berry, and having conquered
nearly the whole district, made a dash upon Auvergne.<a id="Anchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1217.">[1217]</a>
Richard seized the opportunity for an attempt to regain
Châteauroux, in which however he failed, and was only
saved from capture or death by the help of a friendly
butcher.<a id="Anchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1218.">[1218]</a> His advance however had been enough to make
Philip retire into his own domains.<a id="Anchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1219.">[1219]</a> Soon afterwards the
approach of the vintage-season compelled the French king
to disband a part of his forces; the remainder, under command<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">ii.253</a></span>
of the bishop of Beauvais, went to ravage the Norman
frontier-lands. Henry demanded reparation, and threatened
to cast off his allegiance in default of it; Philip retorted
that he would not cease from the warfare which he had
begun till all Berry and the Vexin were in his hands.<a id="Anchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1220.">[1220]</a> At
last, in the middle of August, the two kings met in person
once more between Gisors and Trie; but the meeting broke
up in anger; and when they parted, Philip in his rage cut
down the great elm tree under which the conferences between
the rulers of France and Normandy had so long
been held, vowing that no conference should ever be held
there again.<a id="Anchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1221.">[1221]</a></p>

Both these writers however throw some suspicion upon their account of Philip’s
successes by saying that Henry was flying before him all the while, and was
finally chased back by him into Normandy—which in reality it seems plain that

sitting comfortably under its shade, while the French were broiling in the sun,

they made a dash at them, put them to flight, and then cut down the tree, which
Henry had caused to be carefully enclosed, as a sort of symbol of his ownership

<p>Richard had now rejoined his father,<a id="Anchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1222.">[1222]</a> and at his instigation
an attack was made by their united forces upon Mantes,
which was occupied by a small French force under William
des Barres, lately the commandant of Châteauroux. Richard
succeeded in avenging his recent mishap at Châteauroux by
taking William prisoner, but he made his escape immediately,
and nothing was gained by the expedition.<a id="Anchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1223.">[1223]</a> Richard
again went into Berry; Henry lingered on the Norman
border, where soon afterwards he received from Philip
a demand for another conference. It took place at Châtillon
on October 7, but again without result. Philip now followed
Richard, who thereupon opened negotiations on his own
account, offering to submit his quarrel with Toulouse to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">ii.254</a></span>
judgement of the French king’s court;<a id="Anchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1224.">[1224]</a> but this also came
to nothing. Still the negotiations went on, and Henry’s
difficulties were increasing. Chief among them was the
want of money to pay his soldiers. His realms had been
almost drained for the Saladin tithe; his own treasury was
exhausted; his troops, seeing no prospect of either wages
or plunder, began to slip away; and at last he was obliged
to disband his mercenaries and send his Welsh auxiliaries
back to their own country.<a id="Anchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1225.">[1225]</a> Philip meanwhile was secretly
in communication with Richard;<a id="Anchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1226.">[1226]</a> and Richard was growing
eager to bring matters to a crisis. The insidious whispers
of France and Flanders had done their work in his too
credulous mind. To the end of his life Richard was but
little of a statesman and less of a diplomatist; it is therefore
no wonder that he failed on the one hand to fathom
the subtle policy of his father, and on the other to see
through the wiles of Philip. His fault lay in this—that
while Henry’s servants were content to trust him where they
could not understand him, his own son was ready to find a
ground of suspicion in every word and action of his father’s
for which his own intelligence was incapable of accounting,
and to credit every calumny reported to him by his father’s
enemies. More than a year ago they had contrived, as has
been seen, to awaken in his mind an idea that he was in
danger of being disinherited in favour of his youngest
brother; and it was with a determination to ascertain once
for all the extent of this danger that he brought the two
kings to a meeting with each other and with himself near
Bonmoulins on November 18.<a id="Anchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1227.">[1227]</a></p>

<p>The conference lasted three days; and each day the
prospect of peace grew fainter.<a id="Anchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1228.">[1228]</a> Philip proposed that all
parties should return to the position which they had occupied
before taking the cross; Henry was ready to close with
this proposition, but Richard rejected it, as it would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">ii.255</a></span>
compelled him to give up his conquests won from Toulouse
and worth a thousand marks or more as demesne lands, in
exchange for Châteauroux and a few other castles over
which he would have had only a precarious overlordship.<a id="Anchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1229.">[1229]</a>
As far as the two kings were concerned, the meeting ended
in a simple truce between them, to last till <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Hilary’s day.
No sooner however was this settled than Philip offered to
restore all his conquests on condition that Henry should
cause his subjects to do homage to Richard as his heir, and
should allow his marriage with Adela to take place immediately.
Henry refused.<a id="Anchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1230.">[1230]</a> The two kings were standing, with
Richard and the archbishop of Reims, in the midst of a
crowded ring of spectators. Richard himself now suddenly
turned to his father, and demanded to be distinctly acknowledged
as heir to all his dominions. Henry tried to put
him off; he repeated his demand with the same result.
“Now,” he exclaimed, “I believe what hitherto seemed to
me incredible.” Ungirding his sword, he stretched out his
hands to the king of France and offered him his homage
and fealty for the whole continental heritage of the Angevin
house; an offer which Philip readily accepted, promising in
return to give back to Richard his recent conquests in Berry.<a id="Anchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1231.">[1231]</a>
Henry drew back, speechless with amazement and consternation;
the crowd, seeing the two kings thus separated,
rushed in between them, and the duke of Aquitaine rode
away in company with the French king, leaving Henry
alone with his recollections of all the evils which had come
of his eldest son’s alliance with Louis <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr>, and his forebodings
of worse mischief to come from this new alliance
with Philip, who, as he well knew, was far more dangerous
than Louis had ever been; for he had more brains and even
fewer scruples.<a id="Anchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1232.">[1232]</a></p>

<p>What little could be done to ward off the impending danger
Henry did without delay. He sent the only one of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">ii.256</a></span>
sons on whom he could really depend, Geoffrey the chancellor,
to secure the fortresses of Anjou; he himself went
to do the like in Aquitaine,<a id="Anchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1233.">[1233]</a> whence he returned to keep
Christmas at Saumur. The feast must have been a dreary
one, even if both Geoffrey and John were with him; yet,
deserted as he was, he managed to collect, for the last time,
some semblance of the old regal state.<a id="Anchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1234.">[1234]</a> When the truce
expired, however, he postponed his intended meeting with
Philip, on the plea of illness, first to Candlemas-day, and
then till after Easter. He hoped to make use of the delay
for winning Richard back; but Richard turned a deaf ear
to every message of conciliation.<a id="Anchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1235.">[1235]</a> He had in fact joined
Philip in an attack upon Henry’s territories as soon as the
truce was expired; and the ever-discontented Bretons had
been induced to lend their aid.<a id="Anchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1236.">[1236]</a> After Easter Richard was
at length brought to a meeting with his father, on the
borders of Anjou and Maine; but nothing came of the
interview.<a id="Anchor_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1237.">[1237]</a> In vain did the Pope, fearing that these
quarrels in Gaul would put a stop to the crusade, send two
legates in succession to make peace. The first, Henry of
Albano, who was sent early in 1188 to mediate between
Henry and Louis, unintentionally became the indirect cause
of a further addition to Henry’s troubles. Thinking it
safer to postpone his mediation till the meeting of the two
kings should take place, he in the meantime went to preach
the crusade in Germany and there persuaded the Emperor
himself to take the cross.<a id="Anchor_1238" href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1238.">[1238]</a> By May 1189 Frederic was ready
to start;<a id="Anchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1239.">[1239]</a> but before doing so he took a stern and summary
measure to secure the peace of the Empire during his
absence. He ordered all those princes and nobles whose
loyalty he suspected either to accompany him or to quit
the country and take an oath not to set foot in it again till<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">ii.257</a></span>
his return. Among those who thus incurred banishment
was Henry the Lion. For the second time he and his wife
sought shelter in England; not finding the king there, they
crossed over to Normandy in search of him,<a id="Anchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1240.">[1240]</a> but it does not
appear that they ever reached him where he lay, sick and
weary, at Le Mans.<a id="Anchor_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1241.">[1241]</a> Meanwhile Henry of Albano, after
anathematizing Richard for his disturbance of the peace, had
withdrawn to Flanders and there died.<a id="Anchor_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1242.">[1242]</a> His mission was

peace except the two kings themselves, who were made to
promise that they would submit their quarrels to his arbitration

Canterbury and Rouen, and were threatened with excommunication
if they should fail to redeem their promise.<a id="Anchor_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1244.">[1244]</a></p>

<p>On the basis of this agreement a conference was held on
Trinity Sunday, June 4, at La Ferté-Bernard. There were
present, besides the two kings, Richard, and the legate, the
four archbishops who were to assist him as arbitrators, most
of the Norman bishops, those of Angers and Le Mans, four
English and several French prelates, and a crowd of French,
English and Norman barons.<a id="Anchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1245.">[1245]</a> Philip began by again
demanding that Adela and Richard should be married at
once; that Richard should have security given him for his
succession to his father’s dominions; and that John should
be made to take the cross and accompany his brother to
Palestine.<a id="Anchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1246.">[1246]</a> Richard repeated these demands for himself.<a id="Anchor_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1247.">[1247]</a>
Henry refused, and made a counter-proposition to Philip—the
same which he was said to have made at Châteauroux
two years ago, for Adela’s marriage with John; but this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">ii.258</a></span>
Philip rejected in his turn.<a id="Anchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1248.">[1248]</a> The legate now interposed with
a threat to Philip that unless he would come to terms, his
domains should be laid under interdict; Philip defied the
threat, and charged the legate with having been bribed by
English gold.<a id="Anchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1249.">[1249]</a> This explosion of course broke up the
meeting.<a id="Anchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1250.">[1250]</a> Henry went back to Le Mans, whence neither
bishop nor archbishop, servant nor friend, could persuade
him to move,<a id="Anchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1251.">[1251]</a> although Philip and Richard with their
united forces were overrunning Maine at their will. In
five days the principal castles of its eastern portion were in
their hands; one of the most important, Ballon, only fifteen
miles from Le Mans, fell on June 9. There the conquerors
paused for three days;<a id="Anchor_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1252.">[1252]</a> and there, probably, they received
the submission of the chief nobles of the western border—Geoffrey
of Mayenne, Guy of Laval, Ralf of Fougères.<a id="Anchor_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1253.">[1253]</a> But
while the barons were false, the citizens were true. Le
Mans still clung with unswerving loyalty to the count
whom she looked upon as her own child; and Henry clung
with equal attachment to the city which held his father’s
grave and had held his own cradle.<a id="Anchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1254.">[1254]</a> He had little else
to cling to now. Where John was it is impossible to say;
he was clearly not at Le Mans; and it is certain that,
wherever he may have been, his proceedings were wholly
unknown to Henry.<a id="Anchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1255.">[1255]</a> Geoffrey the chancellor was still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">ii.259</a></span>
at his father’s side, and so were some half-dozen faithful
barons, as well as Archbishop Bartholomew of Tours.<a id="Anchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1256.">[1256]</a>
Beyond these the king had nothing but a small force
of mercenaries wherewith to defend either himself or Le
Mans. The citizens were however willing to stand a
siege for his sake, and he in return had promised never to
desert them.<a id="Anchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1257.">[1257]</a></p>

<abbr title="Roger of">Rog.</abbr> Howden of the proceedings at La Ferté on June 4. It seems most unlikely
that either Philip or Richard would go to a conference at Le Mans itself; and
June 9 is an impossible date, for by that time, as we shall see, the war was in full
career, and Philip and Richard were actually besieging Ballon. Gervase has
probably mistaken both place and date.

<p>On <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Barnabas’s day—Sunday, June 11—Philip and
Richard appeared with their host before Le Mans. They
made a feint of passing on in the direction of Tours;
but next morning Philip suddenly drew up his forces
under the walls and prepared for an assault. The defenders,
conscious of the overwhelming odds against them,
adopted the desperate remedy of setting fire to the suburbs.
Unhappily, the wind carried the flames not into
the enemy’s lines but into the city itself.<a id="Anchor_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1258.">[1258]</a> The French
saw their opportunity and rushed at the bridge; a gallant,
though unsuccessful, attempt to break it down was made
by some of Henry’s troops, headed by a Cenomannian
knight, Geoffrey of Brulon, who thus honourably wiped
out the memory of his rebellion of sixteen years before;
after a desperate fight, Geoffrey was wounded and made
prisoner with a number of his comrades, and the rest
were driven back into the city, the French rushing in
after them.<a id="Anchor_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1259.">[1259]</a> Then at last Henry felt that he could not
keep his promise to the citizens of Le Mans, and with
some seven hundred knights he took to flight.<a id="Anchor_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1260.">[1260]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">ii.260</a></span>
French hurried in pursuit, but they did not carry it far.
It may be that Geoffrey of Brulon’s effort to break down
the bridge saved the king although it could not save the
city; for the French are said to have been checked in
their pursuit by the impossibility of fording the river,<a id="Anchor_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1261.">[1261]</a>
and one can scarcely help conjecturing that the fugitives
had crossed by the half-undermined bridge, and that it fell
as soon as they had passed over it.<a id="Anchor_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1262.">[1262]</a></p>

<p>Geoffrey however was not the only baron who after
siding with Henry’s enemies in his prosperous days had
learned to stand by him in his last hour of need. Besides
his one faithful son, Geoffrey the chancellor, his old friend
Earl William de Mandeville, and William Fitz-Ralf the
seneschal of Normandy, Henry was accompanied in his
flight by an English baron, William the Marshal. William’s
father, John, who seems to have been marshal successively
to Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> and to Stephen, had married a sister of Patrick
of Salisbury and, like his brother-in-law, espoused the cause
of the Empress in the civil war.<a id="Anchor_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1263.">[1263]</a> William himself first
appears in history at the age of about six years, in 1152,
when he was placed as a hostage in the hands of Stephen.
Twice his life was forfeited by his father’s defiance of the
king, and twice it was saved by the unconscious fearlessness
of the child, which so won Stephen’s heart that he ended
by making himself the little fellow’s playmate instead of his
slayer.<a id="Anchor_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1264.">[1264]</a> John’s services to the Empress were rewarded on
Henry’s accession by his reinstatement in the office of
marshal; he afterwards became notorious through his
quarrel with Thomas of Canterbury, which formed one
of the pretexts for the archbishop’s condemnation at
Northampton.<a id="Anchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1265.">[1265]</a> After John’s death his title and office seem
to have been shared by his two sons.<a id="Anchor_1266" href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1266.">[1266]</a> The second, William,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">ii.261</a></span>
we find in 1173 among the partizans of the young king’s rebellion;
ten years later he appears as the young king’s best-beloved
knight, and as charged by him with the last office of
friendship, the accomplishment in his stead of the crusading
vow which he had not lived to fulfil.<a id="Anchor_1267" href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1267.">[1267]</a> Six years afterwards,
however, William was still in Europe, ready to stand to the
last by another perishing king, and to take the post of
honour as well as of danger among the little band of faithful
servants who watched over the last days of Henry Fitz-Empress.
It was William who brought up the rear of the
little force which covered Henry’s retreat from Le Mans.
Turning round as he heard the pursuers close behind him, he
suddenly found himself face to face with Richard, and
levelled his spear at him without hesitation. “God’s feet,
marshal!” cried Richard with his wonted oath, “slay me
not! I have no hauberk.” “Slay you! no; I leave that
to the devil,” retorted William, plunging his spear into the
horse’s body instead of the rider’s.<a id="Anchor_1268" href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1268.">[1268]</a> Richard was of course
compelled to abandon the chase, and at a distance of some
two miles from Le Mans the king felt himself sufficiently
out of danger to pause on the brow of a hill whence he
could look back for the last time upon his native city. As
he saw its blazing ruins words of madness burst from his
lips: “O God, Thou hast shamefully taken from me this day
the city which I loved most on earth, in which I was born
and bred, where lies the body of my father and that of his
patron saint—I will requite Thee as I can; I will withdraw
from Thee that thing in me for which Thou carest the
most.”<a id="Anchor_1269" href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1269.">[1269]</a> Another eighteen miles’<a id="Anchor_1270" href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1270.">[1270]</a> ride brought the fugitives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">ii.262</a></span>
at nightfall to La Frênaye,<a id="Anchor_1271" href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1271.">[1271]</a> whose lord, the viscount of
Beaumont, was a kinsman of Henry, and the father of
Hermengard whose marriage with the king of Scots had
been arranged three years ago by Henry’s influence. The
king found shelter in the castle; his followers, already sadly
diminished in number in consequence of the overpowering
heat and fatigue of the day’s ride, quartered themselves in
the little town as best they could; the chancellor would
have remained with them to keep guard himself, but his
father would not be parted from him, and made him come
in to sup and spend the night. Geoffrey, whose baggage
had been all left in Le Mans, was glad to exchange his
travel-stained clothes for some which his father was able to
lend him; Henry, with characteristic disregard of such
details, persisted in lying down to rest just as he was, with
his son’s cloak thrown over him for a coverlet.<a id="Anchor_1272" href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1272.">[1272]</a></p>

<p>From La Frênaye another day’s ride would have brought
the king to the Norman border. His first intention on
leaving Le Mans had evidently been to fall back upon Normandy
and there rally his forces—doubtless also to summon
help from England—to renew the struggle with Philip; and
this was the course to which his followers still urged him on
the Tuesday morning. He, however, had changed his plans
in the night. He seems to have made up his mind that his
end was near; and in consequence, he had also made up his
mind to go back to the Angevin lands. Since he had been
compelled to leave his own birthplace in the enemy’s power,
he would at any rate stand to the last by the old home of
his father’s house, and die at his hereditary post as count of
Anjou. He made William Fitz-Ralf and William de Mandeville
swear that they would surrender the castles of Normandy
to no one save John; he bade Geoffrey take the
command of the troops, escort the barons with them as far
as Alençon, and then come back to rejoin him in Anjou.
Geoffrey, whose dominant feeling clearly was anxiety for his
father’s personal safety, only stayed in Alençon long enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">ii.263</a></span>
to secure the place and collect a fresh force of a hundred
picked knights, and with these set off southward again to
overtake his father. Henry meanwhile had started for
Anjou almost alone. His son rejoined him at Savigny<a id="Anchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1273.">[1273]</a>—whether
it was the village of that name near Chinon, or one
of several others further north, there is no means of deciding;
but it is certain that by the end of the month Henry and
his son were both safe at Chinon.<a id="Anchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1274.">[1274]</a> Whether the king
had made his way alone, or whether he had been at once
the leader and the guide of the little Norman force, through
the Angevin woodlands which as a hunter he had learned to
know so well, and where he was now in danger of being
hunted down in his turn—in either case this sick and weary
man had achieved an adventure equal in skill and daring to
those of Fulk Nerra’s most romantic days, or of his own
youth. Once safe out of the enemy’s reach, he made no
further movement until Philip, having possessed himself of
the citadel of Le Mans<a id="Anchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1275.">[1275]</a> and the remnant of the Cenomannian
strongholds, and made his way southward by Chaumont and
Amboise as far as Roche-Corbon,<a id="Anchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1276.">[1276]</a> sent him a proposal for a
meeting to be held at Azay on the last day of June.<a id="Anchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1277.">[1277]</a> Henry
apparently advanced from Chinon to Azay; but on that very
day an attack of fever was added to the malady from which
he was already suffering, and he was unable to attend the
conference.<a id="Anchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1278.">[1278]</a> It seems probable that he sent representatives
to whom Philip and Richard made their propositions, and
who may possibly have accepted them in his name.<a id="Anchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1279.">[1279]</a> Certainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">ii.264</a></span>,
however, no truce was made; for that same day
Philip marched up to the southern bank of the Loire and
drew up his host opposite the gates of Tours.<a id="Anchor_1280" href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1280.">[1280]</a> Next day
he forded the river—an easy exploit when it was half dried
up by the summer’s heat<a id="Anchor_1281" href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1281.">[1281]</a>—established his headquarters in
the “borough of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin” or Châteauneuf,<a id="Anchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1282.">[1282]</a> and began to
invest the city.<a id="Anchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1283.">[1283]</a> Henry, it seems, had now gone to Saumur;<a id="Anchor_1284" href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1284.">[1284]</a>
there on the Sunday—July 2—he was visited, according to
one account at his own request, by the archbishop of Reims,
the count of Flanders and the duke of Burgundy, endeavouring
to arrange terms of peace.<a id="Anchor_1285" href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1285.">[1285]</a> The visit was a failure; it
could not be otherwise, for the peacemakers were acting
without Philip’s sanction, and in spite of a distinct warning
from him that, whatever tidings they might bring back, he
would assault Tours next morning.<a id="Anchor_1286" href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1286.">[1286]</a> The morning came;
the assault was made; the walls which had kept out Fulk
Nerra and Geoffrey Martel could not avail to keep out
Philip Augustus, enabled as he was by his possession of
Châteauneuf and by the lack of water in the Loire to bring
up his machines against their weakest side; and in a few
hours he was master of Tours.<a id="Anchor_1287" href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1287.">[1287]</a></p>

<p>The tidings were carried at once to Henry, with a final<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">ii.265</a></span>
summons to meet the conqueror at Colombières, half-way
between Tours and Azay.<a id="Anchor_1288" href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1288.">[1288]</a> Henry, at his wits’ end, consulted
William the Marshal as to whether or not he should
respond to the summons; William recommended him to
follow the counsel of his barons; they advised that he should
go, and he went. Most of his followers went with him;
Geoffrey, however, feeling that he could not endure to see
his father’s humiliation, besought and obtained permission to
remain where he was.<a id="Anchor_1289" href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1289.">[1289]</a> Henry found a lodging in a small
commandery of Knights Templars at Ballan,<a id="Anchor_1290" href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1290.">[1290]</a> close to Colombières;
but he had no sooner reached it than he was seized
with racking pains in every limb and every nerve. He
again called for William the Marshal, who did his best to
soothe him, and persuaded him to go to bed. Philip and
Richard had always refused to believe that his sickness was
anything but a feint, and despite the pleadings of his friends
they still insisted that the conference should take place<a id="Anchor_1291" href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1291.">[1291]</a> on
the following day.<a id="Anchor_1292" href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1292.">[1292]</a> When they saw him, however, they were
compelled to admit the truth of his excuse; his sternly-set
and colourless face shewed but too plainly how acutely he
was suffering. So evident was his weakness that they offered
him a seat—on a cloak spread upon the ground—but he
refused it; he had not come there, he said, to sit down with
them; he had come simply to hear and see what the French
king demanded of him, and why he had taken away his
lands.<a id="Anchor_1293" href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1293.">[1293]</a> Philip formulated his demands with brutal bluntness;
he required that Henry should put himself, as a
conquered enemy, entirely at his mercy before he would
discuss any terms at all.<a id="Anchor_1294" href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1294.">[1294]</a> Henry could not at once bring
himself to submit. Suddenly, amid the breathless stillness
of the sultry July morning, a clap of thunder was heard, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">ii.266</a></span>
the excited bystanders thought they actually saw a stroke of
lightning fall out of the cloudless blue sky, directly between
the two kings. Both started back in terror; after a while
they rode forward again, and immediately there was a second
peal of thunder. Henry’s shattered nerves gave way completely;
he nearly fell from his horse, and at once placed himself
wholly at Philip’s mercy.<a id="Anchor_1295" href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1295.">[1295]</a> Then the terms were dictated
to him. He was made to do homage to Philip, and to
promise that Adela should be placed under guardians chosen
by Richard, who was to marry her on his return from Palestine;—that
Richard should receive the fealty of all the
barons of the Angevin dominions, on both sides of the sea,
and that all who had attached themselves to Richard’s party
in the late war should be suffered to remain in his service
and released from their obligations to his father, at any rate
until the latter should be ready to set forth on the crusade;—that
he would be thus ready, and would meet Philip and
Richard at Vézelay, thence to start with them at Mid-Lent;<a id="Anchor_1296" href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1296.">[1296]</a>—that
he would renounce all claims upon Auvergne,<a id="Anchor_1297" href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1297.">[1297]</a> and
pay Philip an indemnity of twenty thousand marks.<a id="Anchor_1298" href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1298.">[1298]</a> As
security for the fulfilment of the treaty, Philip and Richard
were to hold in pledge either three castles on the Norman
border or two in Anjou, with the cities of Tours and Le
Mans; and all Henry’s barons were to swear that they
would hold their allegiance to him contingent only upon his
fulfilment of these conditions.<a id="Anchor_1299" href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1299.">[1299]</a> Finally, he was compelled
to acknowledge himself reconciled with Richard, and to give
him the kiss of peace. The kiss was indeed given; but it
was accompanied by a whisper which Richard did not scruple
to repeat for the amusement of the French court when the
conference was over—“May I only be suffered to live long
enough to take vengeance upon thee as thou deservest!”<a id="Anchor_1300" href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1300.">[1300]</a></p>

<p>One thing alone Henry asked and obtained in return for
all this humiliation; a written list of those among his subjects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">ii.267</a></span>
whose services were transferred to Richard.<a id="Anchor_1301" href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1301.">[1301]</a> The list
was promised,<a id="Anchor_1302" href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1302.">[1302]</a> and Henry was carried back, worn out with
fatigue, suffering and shame, to the favourite home of his
brighter days at Chinon.<a id="Anchor_1303" href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1303.">[1303]</a> By the time he reached it he was
too ill to do anything but lie down never to rise again. He
sent back his vice-chancellor, Roger Malchat,<a id="Anchor_1304" href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1304.">[1304]</a> to fetch the
promised list of traitors; and on Roger’s return he bade
him sit down beside his bed and read him out the names.
With a sigh Roger answered: “Our Lord Jesus Christ help
me, sire! the first written down here is Count John, your
son.”<a id="Anchor_1305" href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1305.">[1305]</a> The words gave Henry his death-blow. “Say no
more,”<a id="Anchor_1306" href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1306.">[1306]</a> he faltered, turning away his face.<a id="Anchor_1307" href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1307.">[1307]</a> Yet the tale
seemed too horrible to be true, and he started up again:
“Can it be? John, my darling child, my very heart, for love
of whom I have incurred all this misery—has he indeed forsaken
me?” It could not be denied; he sank back again
and turned his face to the wall, moaning: “Let things go
now as they will; I care no more for myself or for the
world.”<a id="Anchor_1308" href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1308.">[1308]</a></p>

says “he returned to Azai,” and makes the reading of the fatal list take place there, before Henry went on to Chinon
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page 70">p. lxx</abbr></cite>). This seems to be the meaning of
    <cite><abbr title="Giraldus Cambrensis" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gir. Cambr.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="De instructione principis">De Instr. Princ.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="part 3">dist.

But Gerald evidently thought Henry had

    <cite>William of Armorica (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Philippi">Philipp.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="book 3">l. iii.</abbr>,

while at Chinon; whereas the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta</i> and Roger shew that both are wrong in this.
On the other hand, the <i>Life of William the Marshal</i> seems distinctly to shew that
the place where Henry went to lodge before the meeting at Colombières was not
Azay, but Ballan; and it also tells us that he went straight back from Colombières
to Chinon, and <i>there</i> read the list. In the absence of further elucidations, I venture
to follow this version.

<p>All through that day and the next he lay there, trembling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">ii.268</a></span>
from head to foot, sometimes appearing to see and hear
nothing, and to be conscious of nothing but pain, murmuring
broken words which no one could understand.<a id="Anchor_1309" href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1309.">[1309]</a> At
other times his delirium shewed itself in frenzied curses upon
himself and his sons, which the attendant bishops vainly
besought him to revoke.<a id="Anchor_1310" href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1310.">[1310]</a> It was Geoffrey who at length
managed to bring him to a somewhat calmer frame both of
body and of mind. With his head on his son’s shoulder and
his feet on the knees of a faithful knight, Henry at last
seemed to have fallen asleep. When he opened his eyes
again and saw Geoffrey patiently watching over him and
fanning away the flies which buzzed around his head, he
spoke in accents very different from any that he had used
for some days past. “My dearest son! thou, indeed, hast
always been a true son to me. So help me God, if I recover
of this sickness, I will be to thee the best of fathers, and
will set thee among the chiefest men of my realm. But if I
may not live to reward thee, may God give thee thy reward
for thy unchanging dutifulness to me!” “O father, I desire
no reward but thy restoration to health and prosperity” was
all that Geoffrey could utter, as the violence of his emotion
so overcame his self-control that he was obliged to rush out
of the room.<a id="Anchor_1311" href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1311.">[1311]</a> The interval of calmness passed away, and
the ravings of delirium were heard again; “Shame, shame
upon a conquered king!” Henry kept muttering over and
over again, till the third morning broke—the seventh day of
the fever<a id="Anchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1312.">[1312]</a>—and brought with it the lightning before death.
Once more Geoffrey, stifling his own distress, came to his
father’s side; once more he was rewarded by seeing Henry’s
eyes open and gaze at him with evident recognition; once
more the dying king recurred wistfully to his plans, not this
time of vengeance upon his rebellious sons, but of advancement
for the loyal one, faintly murmuring in Geoffrey’s ear
how he had hoped to see him bishop of Winchester, or better
still, archbishop of York;<a id="Anchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1313.">[1313]</a> but he knew that for himself all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">ii.269</a></span>
was over. He took off a gold finger-ring, engraved with a
leopard<a id="Anchor_1314" href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1314.">[1314]</a>—the armorial device of the Angevin house—and
handed it to Geoffrey, bidding him send it to the king of
Castille, the husband of his daughter Eleanor; he also gave
directions that another precious ring which lay among his
treasures should be delivered to Geoffrey himself, and gave
him his blessing.<a id="Anchor_1315" href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1315.">[1315]</a> After this he was, by his own desire,
carried into the chapel of the castle and laid before the altar;
here he confessed his sins to the attendant bishops and
priests, was absolved, and devoutly made his last Communion.
Immediately afterwards he passed away.<a id="Anchor_1316" href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1316.">[1316]</a></p>

<p>Then followed one of those strange scenes which so often
occurred after the death of a medieval king. The servants
who should have laid out the body for burial stripped it and
left it naked on the ground; and as during the three days
that he lay dying they had plundered him of everything on
which they could lay their hands, the few friends who were
shocked at the sight could not find a rag wherewith to cover
the dead king, till one of his knights, William de Trihan,
took off his own cloak for the purpose.<a id="Anchor_1317" href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1317.">[1317]</a> All this, however,
was speedily set right by William the Marshal. He at once
took the command of the little party—a duty for which
Geoffrey was evidently unfitted by the violence of his grief—sent
to call as many barons as were within reach to attend
the funeral, and gave directions for the proper robing of the
corpse.<a id="Anchor_1318" href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1318.">[1318]</a> It was no easy matter to arrange within four-and-twenty
hours, and utterly without resources, anything like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">ii.270</a></span>
regal burial for this fallen king.<a id="Anchor_1319" href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1319.">[1319]</a> William, however, managed
to do it; and next day Henry Fitz-Empress, robed as
if for his coronation, with a crown of gold upon his head, a
gold ring on his finger, sandals on his feet, and a sceptre
in his gloved right hand,<a id="Anchor_1320" href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1320.">[1320]</a> was borne upon the shoulders of
his barons down from his castle on the rock of Chinon,
across the viaduct which he himself had built over the swampy
meadows beneath, and thence northward along the left bank
of the silvery, winding Vienne to his burial-place at Fontevraud.<a id="Anchor_1321" href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1321.">[1321]</a>
He had wished to be buried at Grandmont;<a id="Anchor_1322" href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1322.">[1322]</a> but
this of course was impossible now. “He shall be shrouded
among the shrouded women”—so ran the closing words of
a prophecy which during the last few months had been
whispered throughout Henry’s dominions as a token of his
approaching end. It was fulfilled now to the letter, as he
lay in state in the abbey-church of Fontevraud, while the
veiled sisters knelt by night and day murmuring their prayers
and psalms around the bier.<a id="Anchor_1323" href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1323.">[1323]</a></p>

<p>None of the dead king’s friends had thought it necessary
to wait for any instructions from his heir. The marshal,
however, had sent to apprise Richard of his father’s death,
and delayed the burial long enough to give him an opportunity
of attending it if he chose to do so. The other
barons were in great dread of meeting the future king
against whom they had been in arms; and several of them
were even more anxious for the marshal than for themselves,
for they could not but imagine that Richard’s heaviest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">ii.271</a></span>
vengeance would fall upon the man who had unhorsed and
all but killed him at Le Mans. More than one of them
offered to place himself and all his possessions at the service
of the comrade whom they all held in such reverence, if
thereby anything could be done to save him from Richard’s
wrath. But he only answered quietly: “Sirs, I do not
repent me of what I did. I thank you for your proffers;
but, so help me God, I will not accept what I cannot return.
Thanks be to Him, He has helped me ever since I was
made a knight; I doubt not He will help me to the end.”<a id="Anchor_1324" href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1324.">[1324]</a>
Before nightfall Richard overtook them.<a id="Anchor_1325" href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1325.">[1325]</a> He came, it
seems, alone. Vainly did the bystanders seek to read his
feelings in his demeanour; he shewed no sign of either
grief or joy, penitence or wrath; he “spoke not a word,
good or bad,”<a id="Anchor_1326" href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1326.">[1326]</a> but went straight to the church and into the
choir, where the body lay.<a id="Anchor_1327" href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1327.">[1327]</a> For awhile he stood motionless
before the bier;<a id="Anchor_1328" href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1328.">[1328]</a> then he stepped to the head, and looked
down at the uncovered face.<a id="Anchor_1329" href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1329.">[1329]</a> It seemed to meet his gaze
with all its wonted sternness; but there were some who
thought they saw a yet more fearful sight—a stream of
blood which flowed from the nostrils, and ceased only on
the departure of the son who was thus proclaimed as his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">ii.272</a></span>
father’s murderer.<a id="Anchor_1330" href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1330.">[1330]</a> Richard sank upon his knees; thus he
remained “about as long as one would take to say the
Lord’s Prayer;”<a id="Anchor_1331" href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1331.">[1331]</a> then he rose and, speaking for the first
time, called for William the Marshal. William came, accompanied
by a loyal Angevin baron, Maurice of Craon.
Richard bade them follow him out of the church; outside,
he turned at once to the marshal: “Fair Sir Marshal, you
had like to have slain me; had I received your spear-thrust,
it would have been a bad day for both of us!” “My lord,”
answered William, “I had it in my power to slay you; I
only slew your horse. And of that I do not repent me yet.”
With kingly dignity Richard granted him his kingly pardon
at once;<a id="Anchor_1332" href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1332.">[1332]</a> and on the morrow they stood side by side while
Henry Fitz-Empress was laid in his grave before the high
altar by Archbishop Bartholomew of Tours.<a id="Anchor_1333" href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1333.">[1333]</a></p>

(<abbr title="Anglia Christiana Society">Angl. Christ. Soc.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 157)</cite> both distinctly say that he met it at Fontevraud.
The other version is intrinsically most improbable, for Richard can hardly have
been coming from anywhere else than Tours, and in that case he could not possibly
meet the funeral train on its way from Chinon to Fontevraud. That he should
reach Fontevraud some hours after it, on the other hand, is perfectly natural;
and this is just what Gerald and the French <i>Life</i> imply; for they both tell

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">All</span> doubts as to the destination of Henry’s realms after
his death were settled at once by the discovery of John’s
treason. Throughout the Angevin dominions not a voice
was raised to challenge the succession of Richard. The
English marshal and the Angevin barons gathered at Fontevraud
received him unquestioningly as their lord, and were
at once accepted as loyal subjects. One of them indeed,
the seneschal of Anjou, Stephen of Turnham or of Marçay,
was flung into prison for failing to surrender the royal
treasure;<a id="Anchor_1334" href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1334.">[1334]</a> but the reason of his failure seems to have been
simply that the treasury was empty.<a id="Anchor_1335" href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1335.">[1335]</a> According to one
contemporary historian, Richard sealed his forgiveness of
William the Marshal by at once despatching him to England
with a commission to hold the country for him—in effect,
to act as justiciar—till he could proceed thither himself.<a id="Anchor_1336" href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1336.">[1336]</a>
In all probability, however, William was authorized to do
nothing more than set Eleanor at liberty; it was she who,
by her son’s desire, undertook the office of regent in England,<a id="Anchor_1337" href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1337.">[1337]</a>
which she fulfilled without difficulty for the next six
weeks. Geoffrey the chancellor resigned his seal into his
half-brother’s hands as soon as the funeral was over.<a id="Anchor_1338" href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1338.">[1338]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">ii.274</a></span>
promise of the Norman castellans to Henry that they would
surrender to no one but John was of course annulled by
later events. John himself hastened to join his brother;
Richard gave him a gracious welcome, and they returned to
Normandy together.<a id="Anchor_1339" href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1339.">[1339]</a> At Séez the archbishops of Canterbury
and Rouen came to meet them, and absolved Richard
from the excommunication<a id="Anchor_1340" href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1340.">[1340]</a> laid on him by the legate John
of Anagni. Thence they all proceeded to Rouen. On July
20 Richard went in state to the metropolitan church,
where Archbishop Walter girded him with the ducal sword
and invested him with the standard of the duchy.<a id="Anchor_1341" href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1341.">[1341]</a> On the
same day he received the fealty of the Norman barons,<a id="Anchor_1342" href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1342.">[1342]</a> and
held his first court as duke of Normandy, and also, it seems,
as king-elect of England, although there had been no formal
election. He at once made it clear that the abettors of his
revolt had nothing to hope from him—three of the most
conspicuous had been deprived of their lands already<a id="Anchor_1343" href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1343.">[1343]</a>—and
that his father’s loyal servants had nothing to fear, if they
would transfer their loyalty to him. He shewed indeed
every disposition to carry out his father’s last wishes; he at
once nominated Geoffrey for the see of York, and confirmed
Henry’s last grant to John, consisting of the Norman county
of Mortain and four thousand pounds’ worth of land in England;<a id="Anchor_1344" href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1344.">[1344]</a>
at the same time he bestowed upon William the
Marshal the hand of Isabel de Clare, daughter and heiress
of Earl Richard of Striguil, and upon the son of the count
of Perche a bride who had already been sought by two kings—his
niece, Matilda of Saxony.<a id="Anchor_1345" href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1345.">[1345]</a></p>

<p>This last match was evidently intended to secure the
attachment of the important little border-county of Perche
in case of a rupture with France, which seemed by no means
unlikely. The alliance of Philip and Richard had expired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">ii.275</a></span>
with King Henry; now that Richard stood in his father’s
place, Philip saw in him nothing but his father’s successor—the
head of the Angevin house, whose policy was to be
thwarted and his power undermined on every possible occasion
and by every possible means. This was made evident
at a colloquy held on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary Magdalene’s day to settle the
new relations between the two princes; Philip greeted his
former ally with a peremptory demand for the restitution
of the Vexin.<a id="Anchor_1346" href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1346.">[1346]</a> Richard put him off with a bribe of four
thousand marks, over and above the twenty thousand promised
by Henry at Colombières; and on this condition,
accompanied, it seems, by a vague understanding that Richard
and Adela were to marry after all,<a id="Anchor_1347" href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1347.">[1347]</a> Philip agreed to leave
Richard in undisturbed possession of all his father’s dominions,
including the castles and towns which had been
taken from Henry in the last war,<a id="Anchor_1348" href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1348.">[1348]</a> except those of Berry
and Auvergne.<a id="Anchor_1349" href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1349.">[1349]</a> Thus secured, for the moment at least, in
Normandy, Richard prepared to take possession of his island
realm. He had paved the way for his coming there by
empowering Eleanor to make a progress throughout England,
taking from all the freemen of the land oaths of fealty
in his name, releasing captives, pardoning criminals, mitigating,
so far as was possible without upsetting the ordinary
course of justice, the severe administration of the late king.
Richard himself now restored the earl of Leicester and the
other barons whom Henry had disseized six years before.<a id="Anchor_1350" href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1350.">[1350]</a> The
next step was to send home the archbishop of Canterbury and
three other English prelates who were with him in Normandy.<a id="Anchor_1351" href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1351.">[1351]</a>
On August 12 they were followed by Richard himself.<a id="Anchor_1352" href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1352.">[1352]</a></p>

<p>His politic measures of conciliation, executed by his
mother with characteristic intelligence and tact, had secured
him a ready welcome. It was only by slow degrees, and
with the growing experience of years, that the English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">ii.276</a></span>
people learned how much they owed to the stern old king
who was gone. At the moment they thought of him chiefly
as the author of grievances which his son seemed bent upon
removing.<a id="Anchor_1353" href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1353.">[1353]</a> Richard’s mother, with a great train of bishops
and barons, was waiting to receive him at Winchester;<a id="Anchor_1354" href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1354.">[1354]</a> there,
on the vigil of the Assumption, he was welcomed in solemn
procession;<a id="Anchor_1355" href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1355.">[1355]</a> and there, too, he came into possession of the
royal treasury, whose contents might make up for the deficiencies
in that of Anjou.<a id="Anchor_1356" href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1356.">[1356]</a> So complete was his security
that instead of hastening, as his predecessors had done, to
be crowned as soon as possible, he left Eleanor nearly three
weeks in which to make the arrangements for that ceremony,<a id="Anchor_1357" href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1357.">[1357]</a>
while he went on a progress throughout southern England,<a id="Anchor_1358" href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1358.">[1358]</a>
coming back at last to be crowned by Archbishop Baldwin
at Westminster on September 3.<a id="Anchor_1359" href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1359.">[1359]</a> No charter was issued
on the occasion. The circumstances of the new king’s
accession were not such as to make any special call for one;
they were sufficiently met by a threefold oath embodied in
the coronation-service, pledging the sovereign to maintain
the peace of the Church, to put down all injustice, and to
enforce the observance of righteousness and mercy.<a id="Anchor_1360" href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1360.">[1360]</a> In the
formal election by clergy and people which preceded the
religious rite,<a id="Anchor_1361" href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1361.">[1361]</a> and in the essentials of the rite itself, ancient
prescription was strictly followed. The order of the procession
and the details of the ceremonial were, however,
arranged with unusual care and minuteness; it was the most
splendid and elaborate coronation-ceremony that had ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">ii.277</a></span>
been seen in England, and it served as a precedent for all
after-time.<a id="Anchor_1362" href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1362.">[1362]</a> Richard had none of his father’s shrinking from
the pageantries and pomps of kingship; he delighted in its
outward splendours almost as much as in its substantial
powers.<a id="Anchor_1363" href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1363.">[1363]</a> He himself, with his tall figure, massive yet finely-chiselled
features, and soldierly bearing, must have been by
far the most regal-looking sovereign who had been crowned
since the Norman Conqueror; and when Archbishop Baldwin
set the crown upon his golden hair, Englishmen might for a
moment dream that, stranger though he had been for nearly
thirty years to the land of his birth, Richard was yet to be in
reality what he was in outward aspect, a true English king.</p>

<p>Such dreams however were soon to be dispelled. On

homage of the bishops and barons of his realm;<a id="Anchor_1364" href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1364.">[1364]</a> he then
proceeded into Northamptonshire, and on September 15
held a great council at Pipewell.<a id="Anchor_1365" href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1365.">[1365]</a> His first act was to fill
up the vacant sees, of which there were now four besides
that of York. The appointments were made with considerable
judgement. London, whose aged bishop Gilbert Foliot
had died in 1187,<a id="Anchor_1366" href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1366.">[1366]</a> was bestowed upon Richard Fitz-Nigel,<a id="Anchor_1367" href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1367.">[1367]</a>
son of Bishop Nigel of Ely, and for the last twenty years

Walter,<a id="Anchor_1373" href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1373.">[1373]</a> a near connexion of the no less faithful minister of
Henry’s later years, Ralf de Glanville. This last appointment
had also another motive. Hubert Walter was dean of
York; he stood at the head of a party in the York chapter
which had strongly disputed the validity of Geoffrey’s election
in the preceding August, and some of whom had even
proposed the dean himself as an opposition candidate for
the primacy.<a id="Anchor_1374" href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1374.">[1374]</a> Hubert’s nomination to Salisbury cleared this
obstacle out of Geoffrey’s way, and no further protest was
raised when Richard confirmed his half-brother’s election in
the same council of Pipewell.<a id="Anchor_1375" href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1375.">[1375]</a></p>

<p>When, however, the king turned from the settlement of
the Church to that of the state, it became gradually apparent
that his policy in England had only two objects<span class="nobreak">:—</span>to
raise money for the crusade, and to secure the obedience of
his realm during his own absence in the East. These
objects he endeavoured to effect both at once by a wholesale
change of ministers, sheriffs and royal officers in general, at
the council of Pipewell or during the ten days which elapsed
between its dissolution and the Michaelmas Exchequer-meeting.
The practice of making a man pay for the privilege
either of entering upon a public office or of being
released from its burthen was, as we have seen, counted in
no way disgraceful in the days of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, and by no
means generally reprobated under Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> Richard however
carried it to a length which clearly shocked the feelings
of some statesmen of the old school,<a id="Anchor_1376" href="#Footnote_1376" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1376.">[1376]</a> if not those of the
people in general. The first to whom he applied it was no
less a person than the late justiciar, Ralf de Glanville. Ralf<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">ii.279</a></span>
was, like Richard himself, under a vow of crusade, which
would in any case have rendered it impossible for him to
retain the justiciarship after the departure of the English
host for Palestine.<a id="Anchor_1377" href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1377.">[1377]</a> The king, however, insisted that his
resignation should take effect at once,<a id="Anchor_1378" href="#Footnote_1378" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1378.">[1378]</a> and also that it
should be paid for by a heavy fine—a condition which was
also required of the Angevin seneschal, Stephen of Turnham,
as the price of his release from prison.<a id="Anchor_1379" href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1379.">[1379]</a> Worn out though
he was with years and labours,<a id="Anchor_1380" href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1380.">[1380]</a> Ralf faithfully kept his
vow.<a id="Anchor_1381" href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1381.">[1381]</a> If all the intending crusaders had done the same, it
would have been no easy matter to fill his place or to make
adequate provision for the government and administration of
the realm. Both king and Pope, however, had learned that
for eastern as well as western warfare money was even more
necessary than men; Richard had therefore sought and
obtained leave from Clement <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> to commute crusading
vows among his subjects for pecuniary contributions towards
the expenses of the war.<a id="Anchor_1382" href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1382.">[1382]</a> By this means he at once raised
a large sum of money, and avoided the risk of leaving England
deprived of all her best warriors and statesmen during
his own absence. Instead of Ralf de Glanville he appointed
two chief justiciars, Earl William de Mandeville and Bishop
Hugh of Durham;<a id="Anchor_1383" href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1383.">[1383]</a> under these he placed five subordinate
justiciars, one of whom was William the Marshal.<a id="Anchor_1384" href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1384.">[1384]</a> The
bishop-elect of London, Richard Fitz-Nigel, was left undisturbed
in his post of treasurer, where his services were too
valuable for the king to venture upon the risk of forfeiting
them; but the bishop-elect of Ely, although a favourite
servant and almost a personal friend of Richard, had to pay
three thousand pounds for his chancellorship. On the other
hand, Richard proved that in this instance he was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">ii.280</a></span>
actuated solely by mercenary motives, by refusing a still
higher bid from another candidate.<a id="Anchor_1385" href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1385.">[1385]</a> All the sheriffs were
removed from office; some seven or eight were restored
to their old places, five more were appointed to shires other
than those which they had formerly administered;<a id="Anchor_1386" href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1386.">[1386]</a> the
sheriffdom of Hampshire was sold to the bishop-elect of
Winchester,<a id="Anchor_1387" href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1387.">[1387]</a> that of Lincolnshire to Gerard de Camville,
those of Leicestershire, Staffordshire and Warwickshire to
Bishop Hugh of Chester;<a id="Anchor_1388" href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1388.">[1388]</a> and the earldom of Northumberland
was granted on similar terms to the justiciar-bishop of
Durham.<a id="Anchor_1389" href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1389.">[1389]</a></p>

<p>Two other matters had to be dealt with before Richard’s
preparations for departure were completed. To guard his
realm from external disturbance, he must secure the fealty
of the vassal-rulers of Scotland and Wales. To guard it
against internal treason, he must, if such a thing were
possible, secure the loyalty of the brother whom he was
leaving behind him. The first was at once the less important
and the easier matter of the two. Rees of South
Wales had indeed profited by the change of rulers in England
to break the peace which he had been compelled to
maintain with King Henry, and after the council of Pipewell
Richard sent John against him at the head of an armed
force. The other Welsh princes came to meet John at
Worcester and made submission to him as his brother’s
representative;<a id="Anchor_1390" href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1390.">[1390]</a> Rees apparently refused to treat with any
one but the king in person, and accordingly he came back
with John as far as Oxford, but Richard would not take the
trouble to arrange a meeting, and was so unconcerned about
the matter that he let him go home again without an
audience, and, of course, in a state of extreme indignation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">ii.281</a></span><a id="Anchor_1391" href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1391.">[1391]</a>
His threatening attitude served as an excuse for raising a
scutage, nominally for a Welsh war;<a id="Anchor_1392" href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1392.">[1392]</a> but the expedition
was never made. The king of Scots was otherwise dealt
with. Early in December, while Richard was at Canterbury
on his way to the sea, William the Lion came to visit
him, and a bargain was struck to the satisfaction of both
parties. Richard received from William a sum of ten
thousand marks, and his homage for his English estates,
as they had been held by his brother Malcolm; in return,
he restored to him the castles of Roxburgh and Berwick,
and released him and his heirs for ever from the homage for
Scotland itself, enforced by Henry in 1175.<a id="Anchor_1393" href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1393.">[1393]</a></p>

<p>Richard’s worst difficulty however was still unsolved:
how to prevent John from trying to supplant him in his
absence. Richard knew that this lad, ten years younger
than himself, had been his rival ever since he was of an age
to be a rival to any one; and he knew his brother’s character
as, perhaps, no one else did know it as yet—for their
mother had scarcely seen her youngest child since he was
six years old. In the light of later history, it is impossible
not to feel that Richard’s wisest course, alike for his own
sake and for England’s, would have been to follow the
instinct which had once prompted him to insist that John
should go with him to the crusade. In this case however
he was now led astray by the noblest feature in his character,
his unsuspecting confidence and generosity. From
the hour of their reconciliation after their father’s death,
Richard’s sole endeavour respecting John was to gain his
affection and gratitude by showering upon him every
honour, dignity and benefit of which it was possible to
dispose in his favour. The grant of the county of Mortain
made him the first baron of Normandy, and it was accompanied
by a liberal provision in English lands. To these
were added, as soon as the brothers reached England, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">ii.282</a></span>
string of “honours”—Marlborough, Luggershall, Lancaster,
each with its castle; the Peak, Bolsover, and the whole
honour of Peverel; those of Wallingford and Tickhill, and
that of Nottingham, including the town; and the whole
shire of Derby;<a id="Anchor_1394" href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1394.">[1394]</a> besides the honour of Gloucester, which
belonged to John’s betrothed bride Avice, and which Richard
secured to him by causing him to be married to her at
Marlborough on August 29,<a id="Anchor_1395" href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1395.">[1395]</a> in spite of Archbishop Baldwin’s
protests against a marriage between third cousins
without dispensation from the Pope. Baldwin at once laid
all the lands of the young couple under interdict; but John
appealed against him, and a papal legate who came over in
November to settle Baldwin’s quarrel with his own monks
confirmed the appeal and annulled the sentence of the
primate.<a id="Anchor_1396" href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1396.">[1396]</a> At the same time Richard bestowed upon his
brother four whole shires in south-western England—Cornwall,
Devon, Somerset and Dorset—with the ferms and the
entire profits of jurisdiction and administration.<a id="Anchor_1397" href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1397.">[1397]</a> More than
this even Richard could not give; if more was needed to
hold John’s ambition in check, he could only trust to the
skilful management of Eleanor. She was left, seemingly
without any formal commission, but with the practical
authority of queen-regent, and with the dowries of two
former queens in addition to her own.<a id="Anchor_1398" href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1398.">[1398]</a></p>

<p>One important part of Richard’s administrative arrangements
was however already upset: William de Mandeville,
having gone to Normandy on business for the king, died
there on November 14.<a id="Anchor_1399" href="#Footnote_1399" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1399.">[1399]</a> Earl of Essex by grant of
Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, count of Aumale by marriage with its heiress,
William had been through life one of Henry’s most faithful
friends; he was honoured and esteemed by all parties on
both sides of the sea; there was no one left among the
barons who could command anything like the same degree<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">ii.283</a></span>
of general respect; and Richard for the moment saw no
means of filling his place. He therefore left Bishop Hugh
of Durham as sole chief justiciar; but he made a change in
the body of subordinate justiciars appointed at Pipewell.
Two of them were superseded; one was replaced by Hugh
Bardulf, and the other, it seems, by the chancellor William of
Longchamp, who, in addition to the office which he already
held, was put in charge of the Tower of London, and
intrusted with powers which virtually made him equal in
authority to the chief justiciar.<a id="Anchor_1400" href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1400.">[1400]</a></p>

<p>None of these appointments was in itself unwise; but
two worse-matched yokefellows than the justiciar and the
chancellor it would have been difficult to find. Hugh of
Puiset—or “Pudsey,” as his English flock called him—had
stood high in both Church and state ever since the days of
the civil war. Through his mother he was a great-grandson
of the Conqueror, and thus cousin in no remote degree to
Henry Fitz-Empress and Richard Cœur-de-Lion, as well as
to Philip of France. We saw him more than forty years
ago, as archdeacon and treasurer of York, meeting the
ecclesiastical censures of his metropolitan with a retort on
equal terms, and wielding not unsuccessfully the weapons
both of spiritual and temporal warfare in the cause of his
cousin William of York and his uncle Henry of Winchester.
Since 1153 he had been bishop of Durham; certainly not
an ideal successor of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Cuthbert; yet his appointment had
been sanctioned by the saintly archbishop Theobald; and
throughout his long episcopate he shewed himself by no
means ill-fitted, on the whole, for his peculiar position. That
position, it must be remembered, had more than that of any
other English bishop an important political side. The bishop
of Durham was earl palatine of his shire; its whole administration,
secular as well as ecclesiastical, was in his hands.
His diocesan jurisdiction, again, extended over the whole of
Northumberland, and thus brought him into immediate contact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">ii.284</a></span>
with the Scots across the border. His diocese was in
fact a great marchland between England and Scotland; he
was the natural medium of communication or negotiation
between the two realms; and on him depended in no small
degree the security of their relations with each other. For
such a post it was well to have a strong man, in every sense
of the words; and such a man was Hugh of Puiset. His
strength was not based solely upon an unscrupulous use of
great material and political resources. He was a popular
man with all classes; notwithstanding his unclerical ways,
he never fell into any ecclesiastical disgrace except with his
own metropolitan, for whom he was generally more than a
match; and he was one of the very few prelates who managed
to steer their way through the Becket quarrel without
either damaging their reputation as sound churchmen or
forfeiting the confidence of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> His intrigues with
the Scot king and the rebel barons in 1174 failed so completely
and so speedily that Henry found it scarcely worth
while to punish them in any way; and on the other hand,
Hugh’s position was already so independent and secure that
he himself never found it worth while to renew them. In
his own diocese, whatever he might be as a pastor of souls,
he was a vigorous and on the whole a beneficent as well as
magnificent ruler; the men of the county palatine grumbled
indeed at his extravagance and at the occasional hardships
brought upon them by his inordinate love of the chase, but
they were none the less proud of his splendid buildings, his
regal state, and his equally regal personality. His appearance
and manners corresponded with his character and his
rank; he was tall in stature, dignified in bearing, remarkably
attractive in look, eloquent and winning in address.<a id="Anchor_1401" href="#Footnote_1401" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1401.">[1401]</a> Moreover,
he had lived so long in England, and all his interests
had so long been centred there, that for all practical purposes,
social as well as political, he was a thorough Englishman—certainly
far more of an Englishman than his young
English-born cousin, King Richard. For the last eight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">ii.285</a></span>
years, indeed, he had held in the north much the same position
as had belonged in earlier times to the archbishops of
York; for the northern province had been without a metropolitan
ever since the death of Roger of Pont-l’Evêque in
November 1181,<a id="Anchor_1402" href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1402.">[1402]</a> and the supreme authority, ecclesiastical
as well as secular, had thus devolved upon the bishop of
Durham. He was now threatened with the loss of this pre-eminence;
but he had no intention of giving it up without
a struggle, in which his chances of success were at least as
good as those of his rival the archbishop-elect; and whatever
the result might be with respect to his ecclesiastical
independence, he had secured a formidable counterpoise to
the primate’s territorial influence by his purchase of Northumberland,
which made him sole head, under the Crown, of
the civil administration of the whole country between the
Tweed and the Tees.</p>

<p>Alike in himself and in his antecedents Hugh of Puiset
was the very antithesis to William of Longchamp. William
had nothing of the stately presence and winning aspect
which distinguished the bishop of Durham; on the contrary,
he laboured under personal disadvantages which should have
entitled him to sympathy, but which one of his political
opponents was heartless enough to caricature, after his fall,
in order to make him an object of vulgar contempt and disgust.
His stature was diminutive, his countenance swarthy
and ill-favoured, his figure mis-shapen, and he was moreover
very lame.<a id="Anchor_1403" href="#Footnote_1403" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1403.">[1403]</a> His origin was as lowly as his person. His
father was a certain Hugh of Longchamp who in 1156 received
from the king a grant of lands in Herefordshire,<a id="Anchor_1404" href="#Footnote_1404" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1404.">[1404]</a> and
about the time of the barons’ revolt was fermor of the
honour of Conches in Normandy.<a id="Anchor_1405" href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1405.">[1405]</a> His grandfather was
said to have been a French serf who had fled from the
justice of his lord and found a refuge in the Norman village<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">ii.286</a></span>
whence his descendants took their name.<a id="Anchor_1406" href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1406.">[1406]</a> In Henry’s latter
years Hugh of Longchamp was deep in debt and disgrace,<a id="Anchor_1407" href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1407.">[1407]</a>
and his six sons had to make their way in the world as
best they could under the shadow of the king’s displeasure.<a id="Anchor_1408" href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1408.">[1408]</a>
William, whose physical infirmities must have shut him out
from every career save that of a clerk, first appears under
the patronage of Geoffrey the chancellor, as his official in
one of his many pieces of Church preferment, the archdeaconry
of Rouen.<a id="Anchor_1409" href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1409.">[1409]</a> The king, however, remonstrated
strongly with his son on the danger of associating with
a man whom he declared to be “a traitor, like his
father and mother before him.”<a id="Anchor_1410" href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1410.">[1410]</a> The end of his remonstrances
was that, shortly before the last outbreak,
William fled from Geoffrey to Richard, and, according to
one account, became the chief instigator of Richard’s rebellion.<a id="Anchor_1411" href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1411.">[1411]</a>
However this may be, it is certain that Richard, while
still merely duke of Aquitaine, employed William as his
chancellor,<a id="Anchor_1412" href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1412.">[1412]</a> and that he was not only so well satisfied with
his services as to retain him in the same capacity after his
accession to the crown, but had formed such a high opinion
of his statesmanship and his fidelity as to make him his
chief political adviser and confidant. Richard, like his father,
was constant in his friendships, and very unwilling to discard
those to whom he had once become really attached; his
trust in William remained unshaken to the end of his life,
and in some respects it was not misplaced. William seems
to have been thoroughly loyal to his master, and his energy
and industry were as unquestionable as his loyalty. As
Richard’s most intimate companion, confidential secretary,
and political adviser in foreign affairs, William was in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">ii.287</a></span>
right place; but he was by no means equally well fitted to
be Richard’s representative in the supreme government and
administration of England. He had the primary disqualification
of being a total stranger to the land, its people and
its ways. Most likely he had never set foot in England till
he came thither with Richard in 1189; he was ignorant of
the English tongue;<a id="Anchor_1413" href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1413.">[1413]</a> his new surroundings were thoroughly
distasteful to him; and as he was by no means of a cautious
or conciliatory temper, he expressed his contempt and dislike
of them in a way which was resented not only by the
people, but even by men whose origin and natural speech
were scarcely more English than his own.<a id="Anchor_1414" href="#Footnote_1414" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1414.">[1414]</a> He had in short
every qualification for becoming an extremely unpopular
man, and he behaved as if he desired no other destiny. The
nation at large soon learned to return his aversion and to
detest him as a disagreeable stranger; his colleagues in the
administration despised him as an upstart interloper; the
justiciar, in particular, keenly resented his own virtual subordination
to one whom he naturally regarded as his inferior
in every way.<a id="Anchor_1415" href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1415.">[1415]</a> It was sound policy on Richard’s part to
place a check upon Hugh of Durham; and it was not unnatural
that he should select his chancellor for that purpose.
The seven happiest years of Henry Fitz-Empress had been
the years during which another chancellor had wielded a
power almost as great as that which Richard intrusted to
William of Longchamp. But, on the other hand, any one
except Richard might have seen at a glance that of all
statesmen living, William of Longchamp was well-nigh the
least fitted to reproduce the career of Thomas of London.</p>

<p>The king left England on December 11.<a id="Anchor_1416" href="#Footnote_1416" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1416.">[1416]</a> William was
consecrated, together with Richard Fitz-Nigel, on December
31,<a id="Anchor_1417" href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1417.">[1417]</a> and on the feast of the Epiphany he was enthroned at
Ely.<a id="Anchor_1418" href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1418.">[1418]</a> Immediately afterwards he began to assert his temporal
authority. At a meeting of the Court of Exchequer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">ii.288</a></span>
the bishop of Durham was turned out by the chancellor’s
orders; presently after he was deprived of his jurisdiction
over Northumberland. Soon after this, Bishop Godfrey of
Winchester was dispossessed not merely of his sheriffdom
and castles, but even of his own patrimony.<a id="Anchor_1419" href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1419.">[1419]</a> For this last
spoliation there is no apparent excuse; that a man should
hold a sheriffdom together with a bishopric was, however, contrary
alike to Church discipline and to sound temporal policy;
and the non-recognition of Hugh’s purchase of Northumberland
might be yet further justified by the fact that the purchase-money
was not yet paid.<a id="Anchor_1420" href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1420.">[1420]</a> In February 1190 Richard
summoned his mother, his brothers and his chief ministers
to a final meeting in Normandy;<a id="Anchor_1421" href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1421.">[1421]</a> the chancellor, knowing
that complaints against him would be brought before the
king, hurried over in advance of his colleagues, to justify himself
before he was accused,<a id="Anchor_1422" href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1422.">[1422]</a> and he succeeded so well that
Richard not only sent him back to England after the council
with full authority to act as chief justiciar as well as chancellor,<a id="Anchor_1423" href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1423.">[1423]</a>
but at the same time opened negotiations with Rome
to obtain for him a commission as legate<a id="Anchor_1424" href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1424.">[1424]</a>—an arrangement
which, the archbishop of Canterbury being bound on crusade
like the king, would leave William supreme both in Church
and state.</p>

<p>The new justiciar’s first act on his return was to fortify
the Tower of London;<a id="Anchor_1425" href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1425.">[1425]</a> his next was to punish a disturbance
which had lately occurred at York. During the last six
months the long-suppressed hatred which the Jews inspired
had broken forth into open violence. The first pretext had
been furnished by a misunderstanding on the coronation-day.
Richard, who had some very strict ideas about the ceremonials
of religion, had given orders that no Jew should approach
him on that solemn occasion; in defiance or ignorance of
the prohibition, some rich Jews came to offer gifts to the
new sovereign; the courtiers and the people seized the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">ii.289</a></span>
excuse to satisfy at once their greed and their hatred; the
unwelcome visitors were driven away, robbed, beaten, some
even slain;<a id="Anchor_1426" href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1426.">[1426]</a> and the rage of their enemies, once let loose,
spent itself throughout the night in a general sack of the
Jewish quarter. Richard, engaged at the coronation-banquet,
knew nothing of what had happened till the next day,<a id="Anchor_1427" href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1427.">[1427]</a> when
he did his best to secure the ringleaders, and punished them
severely.<a id="Anchor_1428" href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1428.">[1428]</a> When he was gone, however, the spark thus
kindled burst forth into a blaze in all the chief English
cities in succession, Winchester being almost the sole exception.<a id="Anchor_1429" href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1429.">[1429]</a>
Massacres of Jews took place at Norwich on February
6, at Stamford on March 7, at <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s on March 18,
Palm Sunday.<a id="Anchor_1430" href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1430.">[1430]</a> A day before this last, a yet worse
tragedy had occurred at York. The principal Jews of that
city, in dread of a popular attack, had sought and obtained
shelter in one of the towers of the castle, under the protection
of its constable and the sheriff of Yorkshire.<a id="Anchor_1431" href="#Footnote_1431" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1431.">[1431]</a> Once there,
they refused to give it up again; whereupon the constable
and the sheriff called out all the forces of city and shire to
dislodge them. After twenty-four hours’ siege the Jews
offered to ransom themselves by a heavy fine; but the blood
of the citizens was up, and they rejected the offer. The
Jews, in desperation, resolved to die by their own hands
rather than by those of their Gentile enemies; the women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">ii.290</a></span>
and children were slaughtered by their husbands and fathers,
who flung the corpses over the battlements or piled them up
in the tower, which they fired.<a id="Anchor_1432" href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1432.">[1432]</a> Nearly five hundred Jews
perished in the massacre or the flames;<a id="Anchor_1433" href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1433.">[1433]</a> and the citizens and
soldiers, baulked of their expected prey, satiated their greed
by sacking and burning all the Jewish houses and destroying
the bonds of all the Jewish usurers in the city.<a id="Anchor_1434" href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1434.">[1434]</a> At the
end of April or the beginning of May<a id="Anchor_1435" href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1435.">[1435]</a> the new justiciar
came with an armed force to York to investigate this affair.
The citizens threw the whole blame upon the castellan and
the sheriff; William accordingly deposed them both.<a id="Anchor_1436" href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1436.">[1436]</a> As
the castle was destroyed, he probably thought it needless to
appoint a new constable until it should be rebuilt; for the
sheriff—John, elder brother of William the Marshal—he at
once substituted his own brother Osbert.<a id="Anchor_1437" href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1437.">[1437]</a> Most of the
knights who had been concerned in the tumult had taken
care to put themselves out of his reach; their estates were,
however, mulcted and their chattels seized;<a id="Anchor_1438" href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1438.">[1438]</a> and the citizens
only escaped by paying a fine<a id="Anchor_1439" href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1439.">[1439]</a> and giving hostages who
were not redeemed till three years later, when all thought of
further proceedings in the matter had been given up.<a id="Anchor_1440" href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1440.">[1440]</a> Even
the clergy of the minster had their share of punishment,
although for a different offence: William, though his legatine
commission had not yet arrived, claimed already to be
received as legate, and put the church under interdict until
his claim was admitted.<a id="Anchor_1441" href="#Footnote_1441" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1441.">[1441]</a></p>

<p>For the moment William’s power was undisputed even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">ii.291</a></span>
in the north; for Hugh of Durham was still in Gaul. Now,
however, there came a notice from the king that he was
about to send Hugh back to England as justiciar over the
whole country north of the Humber.<a id="Anchor_1442" href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1442.">[1442]</a> Hugh himself soon
afterwards arrived, and hurried northward, in the hope, it
seems, of catching the chancellor on the further side of the
Humber and thus compelling him to acknowledge his
inferiority.<a id="Anchor_1443" href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1443.">[1443]</a> In this hope he was disappointed; they met
at Blyth in Nottinghamshire.<a id="Anchor_1444" href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1444.">[1444]</a> Hugh, impetuous in old age
as in youth, talked somewhat too much as the chancellor
had acted—“as if all the affairs of the realm were dependent
on his nod.”<a id="Anchor_1445" href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1445.">[1445]</a> At last, however, he produced the commission
from Richard upon which his pretensions were founded;<a id="Anchor_1446" href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1446.">[1446]</a>
and William, who could read between the lines of his royal
friend’s letters, saw at once that he had little to fear.<a id="Anchor_1447" href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1447.">[1447]</a> He
replied simply by expressing his readiness to obey the king’s
orders,<a id="Anchor_1448" href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1448.">[1448]</a> and proposing that all further discussion should be
adjourned to a second meeting a week later at Tickhill.
There Hugh found the tables turned. The chancellor had
reached the place before him; the bishop’s followers were
shut out from the castle; he was admitted alone into the
presence of his rival, who, without giving him time to speak,
put into his hands another letter from Richard, bidding all
his English subjects render service and obedience to “our
trusty and well-beloved chancellor, the bishop of Ely,” as
they would to the king himself. The letter was dated June
6—some days, if not weeks, later than Hugh’s credentials;<a id="Anchor_1449" href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1449.">[1449]</a>
and it seems to have just reached William together with his
legatine commission, which was issued on the previous day.<a id="Anchor_1450" href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1450.">[1450]</a>
He gave his rival no time even to think. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">ii.292</a></span>“You had your
say at our last meeting; now I will have mine. As my
lord the king liveth, you shall not quit this place till you
have given me hostages for the surrender of all your castles.
No protests! I am not a bishop arresting another bishop;
I am the chancellor, arresting his supplanter.”<a id="Anchor_1451" href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1451.">[1451]</a> Hugh was
powerless; yet he let himself be dragged all the way to
London before he would yield. Then he gave up the
required hostages,<a id="Anchor_1452" href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1452.">[1452]</a> and submitted to the loss of all his
lately-purchased honours—Windsor, Newcastle, Northumberland,
even the manor of Sadberge which he had bought of
the king for his see<a id="Anchor_1453" href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1453.">[1453]</a>—everything, in short, except his
bishopric. For that he set out as soon as he was liberated;
but at his manor of Howden he was stopped by the chancellor’s
orders, forbidden to proceed further, and again
threatened with forcible detention. He promised to remain
where he was, gave security for the fulfilment of his promise,
and then wrote to the king his complaints of the treatment
which he had received.<a id="Anchor_1454" href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1454.">[1454]</a> All the redress that he could get,

<p>The chancellor’s first rival was thus suppressed; but
already he could see other stumbling-blocks arising in his
path, not a few of them placed there by the shortsighted
policy of his royal master. Richard’s reckless bestowal of
lands and jurisdictions would, if left undisturbed, have put
the administration of at least ten whole shires practically
beyond the control of the central government. The bishops
of Durham, Winchester and Coventry or Chester would have
had everything their own way, in temporal matters no less
than in spiritual, throughout their respective dioceses. To
this state of things William had summarily put an end in
the cases of Northumberland and Hampshire; in those of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">ii.293</a></span>
Leicestershire, Staffordshire and Warwickshire the primate
had been induced to remonstrate with Hugh of Coventry
upon the impropriety of a bishop holding three sheriffdoms,
and Hugh had accordingly given up two of them, though he
managed to get them back after Baldwin’s death at the close
of 1190.<a id="Anchor_1456" href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1456.">[1456]</a> There were however still four shires in the south-west
and one in Mid-England over which the king’s justiciar
was not only without practical, but even without legal
jurisdiction. In these, and in a number of “honours” scattered
over the midland shires from Gloucester to Nottingham,
the whole rights and profits of government, administration
and finance belonged solely to John; for his exercise of
them he was responsible to no one but the king; and thus,
as soon as Richard was out of reach, John was to all intents
and purposes himself king of his own territories. For the
present indeed he was unable to set foot in his little realm:
Richard in the spring had made both his brothers take an
oath to keep away from England for three years.<a id="Anchor_1457" href="#Footnote_1457" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1457.">[1457]</a> It was
however easy enough for John to govern his part of England,
as the whole of it had often been governed for years together,
from the other side of the Channel. He had his staff of
ministers just like his brother—his justiciar Roger de Planes,<a id="Anchor_1458" href="#Footnote_1458" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1458.">[1458]</a>
his chancellor Stephen Ridel,<a id="Anchor_1459" href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1459.">[1459]</a> his seneschal William de
Kahaines, and his butler Theobald Walter;<a id="Anchor_1460" href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1460.">[1460]</a> the sheriffs of
his five counties and the stewards or bailiffs of his honours
were appointed by him alone, and exercised their functions
solely for his advantage, without reference to the king’s court
or the king’s exchequer.<a id="Anchor_1461" href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1461.">[1461]</a> It is evident that, even though as
yet the sea lay between them, John had already the power
to make himself, if he were so minded, a serious obstacle to
the chancellor’s plans of governing England for Richard.
Moreover, before Richard finally quitted Gaul, his mother
persuaded him to release John from his oath of absence;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">ii.294</a></span><a id="Anchor_1462" href="#Footnote_1462" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1462.">[1462]</a>
and William of Longchamp himself, in his new character of
legate, was obliged to confirm the release with his absolution.<a id="Anchor_1463" href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1463.">[1463]</a>
In view of the struggle which he now saw could not be far
distant, William began to marshal his political forces and
concert his measures of defence. On August 1 he held a
Church council at Gloucester, in the heart of John’s territories;<a id="Anchor_1464" href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1464.">[1464]</a>
on October 13 he held another at Westminster;<a id="Anchor_1465" href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1465.">[1465]</a> and
he seems to have spent the winter in a sort of half legatine,
half vice-regal progress throughout the country, for purposes
of justice and finance and for the assertion of his own
authority. This proceeding stirred up a good deal of
discontent. Cripple though he was, William of Longchamp
seems to have been almost as rapid and restless a traveller
as Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>; one contemporary says he “went up and
down the country like a flash of lightning.”<a id="Anchor_1466" href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1466.">[1466]</a> It may be
however that these words allude to the disastrous effects of
the chancellor’s passage rather than to its swiftness and
suddenness; for he went about in such state as no minister
except Henry’s first chancellor had ever ventured to assume.
His train of a thousand armed knights, besides a crowd of
clerks and other attendants, was a ruinous burthen to the religious
houses where he claimed entertainment; and the burthen
was made almost unbearable by the heavy exactions, from clerk
and layman alike, which he made in his master’s name.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">ii.295</a></span><a id="Anchor_1467" href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1467.">[1467]</a></p>

<p>That master was now with Philip of France at Messina,<a id="Anchor_1468" href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1468.">[1468]</a>
preparing for his departure from Europe. When he would
come back—whether he ever would come back at all—was
felt by all parties to be doubtful in the extreme. With his
ardent zeal, rash valour and peculiar health, he was little
likely to escape both the chances of war and the effects of
the eastern climate;<a id="Anchor_1469" href="#Footnote_1469" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1469.">[1469]</a> and the question of the succession was
therefore again becoming urgent. There was indeed not
much latitude of choice; the male line of Anjou, already
extinct in Palestine, had in Europe only three representatives—Richard
himself, John, and their infant nephew Arthur of
Britanny. By the strict feudal rule of primogeniture, Arthur,
being Geoffrey’s son, would have after Richard the next
claim as head of the Angevin house. By old English constitutional
practice, John, being a grown man and the reigning
sovereign’s own brother, would have a much better
chance of recognition as his successor than his nephew,
a child not yet four years old. Neither alternative was
without drawbacks. Richard himself had made up his
mind to the first; early in November 1190 he arranged a
marriage for Arthur with a daughter of King Tancred of
Sicily, on a distinct understanding that in case of his own
death without children Arthur was to succeed to all his
dominions;<a id="Anchor_1470" href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1470.">[1470]</a> while at the same time William of Longchamp
was endeavouring to secure the Scot king’s recognition of
Arthur as heir-presumptive to the English crown.<a id="Anchor_1471" href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1471.">[1471]</a> The
queen-mother was unwilling to contemplate the succession
of either Arthur or John; she was anxious to get Richard
married. Knowing that he never would marry the woman
to whom he had been so long betrothed, she took upon
herself to find him another bride. Her choice fell upon
Berengaria, daughter of King Sancho <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> of Navarre;<a id="Anchor_1472" href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1472.">[1472]</a> it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">ii.296</a></span>
was accepted by Richard; early in February 1191<a id="Anchor_1473" href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1473.">[1473]</a> she
went over to Gaul; there she met her intended daughter-in-law,
whom she carried on with her into Italy, and by the
end of March they were both with Richard at Messina.<a id="Anchor_1474" href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1474.">[1474]</a> On

he at once plighted his troth to Berengaria; and when his

<p>On her way home Eleanor stopped to transact some
diplomatic business at Rome, and she seems to have remained
in Gaul until the beginning of the next year. Long
before she returned to England there were evident tokens
that when Richard had proposed to keep John out of it, he
had for once been wiser than his mother. Early in the
year John, profiting by the liberty which her intercession
had procured him, came over to England and there set up
his court in such semi-regal state as to make it a source of
extreme irritation, if not of grave anxiety, to the chancellor.<a id="Anchor_1480" href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1480.">[1480]</a>
Eleanor’s departure thus left William of Longchamp face to
face with a new and most formidable rival; while about the
same time he saw his power threatened on another side.
In March 1191 tidings came that Archbishop Baldwin had
died at Acre in the foregoing November.<a id="Anchor_1481" href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1481.">[1481]</a> If a new primate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">ii.297</a></span>
should be appointed, it was to be expected as a matter of
course that the bishop of Ely would lose the legation; he
could hope to retain it only by persuading Richard either to
nominate him to the primacy, or to keep it vacant altogether.
Richard’s notions of ecclesiastical propriety were however too
strict to admit the latter alternative; from the former he
would most likely be deterred by his father’s experiences with
another chancellor; so, to the astonishment of everybody,
he nominated for the see of Canterbury a Sicilian prelate,
one of his fellow-crusaders, William archbishop of Monreale.<a id="Anchor_1482" href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1482.">[1482]</a>
Meanwhile John and the chancellor were quarrelling openly;
popular sympathy, which William had alienated by his arrogance
and his oppressions, was on the side of John; even
the subordinate justiciars, who had stood by William in his
struggle with Hugh of Durham,<a id="Anchor_1483" href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1483.">[1483]</a> were turning against him
now; from one and all complaints against him were showering
in upon the king;<a id="Anchor_1484" href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1484.">[1484]</a> till at the end of February Richard grew
so bewildered and so uneasy that he decided upon sending
the archbishop of Rouen to investigate the state of affairs in
England and see what could be done to remedy it.<a id="Anchor_1485" href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1485.">[1485]</a></p>

<p>The archbishop of Rouen—Walter of Coutances—was a
man of noble birth and stainless character who had been
successively archdeacon of Oxford, treasurer of Rouen
cathedral and vice-chancellor to Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>;<a id="Anchor_1486" href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1486.">[1486]</a> in this last
capacity he had for eight years done the whole work of
head of the chancery for his nominal chief Ralf of Varneville,<a id="Anchor_1487" href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1487.">[1487]</a>
till Ralf was succeeded in 1182 by the king’s son
Geoffrey, and next year the vice-chancellor was promoted to
the see of Lincoln, which Geoffrey had resigned. A year
later Walter was advanced to the primacy of Normandy.<a id="Anchor_1488" href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1488.">[1488]</a>
He was now with Richard, on his way to Holy Land, but
commuted his vow to serve the king.<a id="Anchor_1489" href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1489.">[1489]</a> He was a very quiet,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">ii.298</a></span>
unassuming person, and certainly not a vigorous statesman;
but his integrity and disinterestedness were above question;<a id="Anchor_1490" href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1490.">[1490]</a>
and the position in which he was now placed was one
in which even a Thomas Becket might well have been
puzzled how to act. The only commission given him by
Richard of which we know the date was issued on February
23;<a id="Anchor_1491" href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1491.">[1491]</a> but it was not till April 2 that he was allowed to leave
Messina;<a id="Anchor_1492" href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1492.">[1492]</a> and during the interval Richard, in his reluctance
to supersede the chancellor, seems to have been perpetually
changing his mind and varying his instructions, some of
which were sent direct to England and some intrusted to
Walter, till by the time the archbishop started he was laden
with a bundle of contradictory commissions, addressed to
himself, to William and to the co-justiciars, and apparently
accompanied by a verbal order to use one, all or none of
them, wholly at his own discretion.<a id="Anchor_1493" href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1493.">[1493]</a></p>

<p>Before he reached England John and the chancellor
were at open war. On Mid-Lent Sunday they met at
Winchester to discuss the payment of John’s pensions from
the Exchequer and the possession of certain castles within
his territories.<a id="Anchor_1494" href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1494.">[1494]</a> The discussion clearly ended in a quarrel;
and this served as a signal for revolt against the unpopular
minister. Gerard de Camville, sheriff of Lincolnshire by
purchase from the king, was also constable of Lincoln castle
in right of his wife Nicolaa de Haye. He was accused of
harbouring robbers in the castle, and when summoned
before the king’s justices he refused to appear, declaring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">ii.299</a></span>
that he had become John’s liegeman and was answerable
only to him.<a id="Anchor_1495" href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1495.">[1495]</a> At the opposite end of England Roger
de Mortemer, the lord of Wigmore—successor to that
Hugh de Mortemer who had defied Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> in 1156—was
at the same moment found to be plotting treason
with the Welsh. Against him the chancellor proceeded
first, and his mere approach so alarmed Roger that he
gave up his castle and submitted to banishment from
the realm for three years.<a id="Anchor_1496" href="#Footnote_1496" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1496.">[1496]</a> William then hurried to Lincoln;
but before he could reach it Gerard and Nicolaa
had had time to make their almost impregnable stronghold
ready for a siege, and John had had time to gain possession
of Nottingham and Tickhill<a id="Anchor_1497" href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1497.">[1497]</a>—two castles which the king
had retained in his own hands, while bestowing upon his
brother the honours in which they stood. Nicolaa was in
command at Lincoln, and was fully equal to the occasion;
her husband was now with John, and John at once sent the
chancellor a most insulting message, taunting him with the
facility with which the two castles had been betrayed,<a id="Anchor_1498" href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1498.">[1498]</a> and
threatening that if the attempt upon Lincoln was not at
once given up, he would come in person to avenge the
wrongs of his liegeman.<a id="Anchor_1499" href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1499.">[1499]</a> William saw that John was now
too strong for him; he knew by this time that Pope
Clement was dead,<a id="Anchor_1500" href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1500.">[1500]</a> and his own legation consequently at
an end; he must have known, too, of the mission of Walter
of Rouen; he therefore, through some of his fellow-bishops,<a id="Anchor_1501" href="#Footnote_1501" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1501.">[1501]</a>
demanded a personal meeting with John, and proposed that
all their differences should be submitted to arbitration.
John burst into a fury at what he chose to call the impudence
of this proposal,<a id="Anchor_1502" href="#Footnote_1502" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1502.">[1502]</a> but he ended by accepting it,
and on April 25 the meeting took place at Winchester.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">ii.300</a></span>
The case was decided by the bishops of London, Winchester
and Bath, with eleven lay arbitrators chosen by them from
each party. Their decision went wholly against the chancellor.
He was permitted to claim the restitution of Nottingham
and Tickhill, but only to put them in charge of two
partizans of John; his right to appoint wardens to the other
castles in dispute was nominally confirmed, but made
practically dependent upon John’s dictation; he was compelled
to reinstate Gerard de Camville, and moreover to
promise that in case of Richard’s death he would do his
utmost to secure the crown for John.<a id="Anchor_1503" href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1503.">[1503]</a></p>

<p>Two days later Walter of Rouen landed at Shoreham.<a id="Anchor_1504" href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1504.">[1504]</a>
He was evidently not wanted now to act as a check upon
William of Longchamp; he might almost expect to be soon
wanted as a check upon John; but meanwhile, he could
only stand aside and watch the effect of the new arrangements.
His passive attitude gave, however, an indirect
support to the chancellor; after midsummer, therefore, the
latter ventured to repudiate the concessions wrung from
him at Winchester; he again advanced upon Lincoln, and
formally deprived Gerard of the sheriffdom, which he conferred
upon William de Stuteville.<a id="Anchor_1505" href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1505.">[1505]</a> Once more the other
bishops interposed, backed now by the Norman primate.
Another assembly met at Winchester on July 28,<a id="Anchor_1506" href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1506.">[1506]</a> and here
a fresh settlement was made. Gerard was reinstated in the
sheriffdom of Lincolnshire, pending his trial in the king’s
court; William and John were both bound over to commit
no more forcible disseizures; the disputed castles were to be
again put in charge for the king, but through the medium of
the archbishop of Rouen instead of the chancellor, and John
was allowed no voice in the selection of the castellans, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">ii.301</a></span>
were chosen by the assembly then and there. If the chancellor
should infringe the agreement, or if the king should

to his claims upon the succession to the throne was
carefully omitted.<a id="Anchor_1507" href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1507.">[1507]</a> The contest almost seemed to have
ended in a drawn battle. It was strictly a contest between
individuals, involving no national or constitutional interests.
The barons, as a body, clearly sided with John; but, just as
clearly, they sided with him from loyal motives. The
authority of the Crown was never called in question; the
question was, who was fittest to represent and uphold it—the
king’s chancellor, or his brother. Of treason, either
to England or to Richard, there was not a thought, unless—as
indeed is only too probable—it lurked in the mind of
John himself.</p>

<p>A drawn battle, however, could not possibly be the end
of a struggle between two such men as John of Mortain and
William of Longchamp. In the autumn a new element was
added to the strife by the return of Archbishop Geoffrey of
York. For thirty-five years Geoffrey had been the eldest
living child, if indeed he was not actually the first-born, of
Henry Fitz-Empress;<a id="Anchor_1508" href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1508.">[1508]</a> but of the vast Angevin heritage
there fell to his share nothing, except the strong feelings
and fiery temper which caused half the troubles of his life.
As a child he had been brought up at court almost on equal
terms with his half-brothers;<a id="Anchor_1509" href="#Footnote_1509" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1509.">[1509]</a> he seems indeed to have been
his father’s favourite, till he was supplanted by the little
John. When he grew to manhood, however, Henry could
see no way of providing for him except by forcing him into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">ii.302</a></span>
a career for which he had no vocation. At an early age he
was put into deacon’s orders and made archdeacon of Lincoln;<a id="Anchor_1510" href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1510.">[1510]</a>
in 1173, when about twenty years of age, he was
appointed to the bishopric of the same place.<a id="Anchor_1511" href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1511.">[1511]</a> The Pope,
however, demurred to the choice of a candidate disqualified
alike by his youth and his birth; and when the former
obstacle had been outlived and the latter might have been
condoned, Geoffrey voluntarily renounced an office in which
he would have been secure for life, but which he had never
desired and for which he felt himself unfit,<a id="Anchor_1512" href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1512.">[1512]</a> in order to
become his father’s chancellor and constant companion
during the last eight years of his life. It was Henry’s last
regret that this son, the only one of his sons whose whole
life had been an unbroken course of perfect filial obedience,
had to be left with his future entirely at the mercy of his
undutiful younger half-brother. Richard received him with
a brotherly welcome;<a id="Anchor_1513" href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1513.">[1513]</a> when, however, he nominated him to
the see of York, he was indeed carrying out their father’s
last wishes, but certainly not those of Geoffrey himself.
Richard seems to have thought that he was held back by
other motives than those of conscience or of preference for a
secular life; he suspected him of cherishing designs upon
the crown.<a id="Anchor_1514" href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1514.">[1514]</a> It can only be said that Geoffrey, so far as
appears, never did anything to justify the suspicion, but
shewed on the contrary every disposition to act loyally
towards both his brothers, if they would but have acted with
equal loyalty towards him. As soon however as the tonsure
had marked him irrevocably for a priestly life,<a id="Anchor_1515" href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1515.">[1515]</a> Richard’s
zeal for his promotion cooled. The bishop of Durham, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">ii.303</a></span>
was striving to make his see independent of the metropolitan,<a id="Anchor_1516" href="#Footnote_1516" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1516.">[1516]</a>
and a strong party in the York chapter with whom
Geoffrey had quarrelled on a point of ecclesiastical etiquette,
easily won the king’s ear;<a id="Anchor_1517" href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1517.">[1517]</a> it was not till the very eve of
Richard’s departure from England that Geoffrey was able to
buy his final confirmation both in the see of York and in
the estates which his father had bequeathed to him in
Anjou;<a id="Anchor_1518" href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1518.">[1518]</a> and in March he was summoned over to Normandy
and there, like John, made to take an oath of absence from
England for three years.<a id="Anchor_1519" href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1519.">[1519]</a></p>

In the first chapter of his
    <cite><i>Life</i> by Gerald (Brewer, <abbr title="volume 4">vol. iv.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 363)</cite>,
we are
told that Geoffrey was scarcely twenty when elected to Lincoln, <i>i.e.</i> in 1173. But
in
    <cite><abbr title="book 1">l. i.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 13 (<i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 384)</cite>,
Gerald says that he was consecrated to York “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">anno
ætatis quasi quadragesimo</span>,” in 1191. These two dates, as is usual with Gerald in
such cases, do not agree, and neither of them pretends to be more than approximate.
Still it seems plain that Geoffrey’s birth must fall somewhere between 1151
and 1153. Even if we adopt the latest date, he must have been born in the same
year as Eleanor’s first son—the baby William who died in 1156—and must have
been at least two years older than the young king, four years older than Richard,
and fourteen years older than John.

<p>According to Geoffrey’s own account, he followed his
brother as far as Vézelay, and there won from him a remission
of this vow.<a id="Anchor_1520" href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1520.">[1520]</a> It is certain that by April 1191 Richard
had so far changed his mind again as to be desirous of
Geoffrey’s speedy consecration. The Pope’s consent was
still lacking; and the negotiations for obtaining this were
undertaken by the person who, from Geoffrey’s very birth,
had been his most determined enemy—Queen Eleanor.
When she went from Messina to Rome to plead his cause
with Clement <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> or his successor Celestine,<a id="Anchor_1521" href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1521.">[1521]</a> it is plain that
natural feeling gave way to motives of policy. She could
now see that an archbishop of York might become very
useful in England, in holding the balance between Hugh of
Durham and William of Ely. His canonical authority and
personal influence might furnish, not indeed a counterpoise,
but at least a check to the now unlimited powers of the
legate. On the other hand, it was the long vacancy of York
which more than anything else had tended to Hugh’s exaltation.
For ten years the bishop of Durham, with no
metropolitan over him, had virtually been himself metropolitan
of northern England. He strongly resented the
filling of the vacant see, and had actually obtained from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">ii.304</a></span>
Clement <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> a privilege of exemption from its jurisdiction.<a id="Anchor_1522" href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1522.">[1522]</a>
If the archbishop of York could be reinstated in his proper
constitutional position, his own interests would lead him to
use it for those of the kingdom and the king.</p>

<p>Geoffrey’s qualifications and disqualifications for such a
task may be very easily summed up. He had the Angevin
fearlessness, energy, persistence and thoroughness, with a fair
share of the versatile capabilities of the family; he had all
their impetuosity, but very little of their wariness and tact.
Mingled with the Angevin fire, there seems to have run in
his veins the blood, and with it the spirit, of a totally different
race. If we may credit on such a point the gossip of
his father’s court, Geoffrey was through his mother a child
of the people—seemingly the English people—and of its
very lowest class.<a id="Anchor_1523" href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1523.">[1523]</a> This consideration has more interest at
a later stage of Geoffrey’s career, when he stands forth as a
champion of constitutional liberty. Until then, there is, so
far as we can see, no evidence of any special sympathy
between him and the English people. Yet the plebeian and
probably English element in him existed, or was believed to
exist; and if it did not become, as it easily might have done,
an important element in his political career, it was at any
rate not unlikely to have exercised some influence upon his
character.</p>

Walter is
the only writer who tells us anything about Geoffrey’s mother; as he does not
say she was a foreigner, it seems most probable that he looked upon her as an
Englishwoman. The name which he gives to her—“Ykenai” or “Hikenai”—tells
nothing either way, in itself. But
    <cite>Mr. Dimock (in his preface to the seventh
volume of Gerald’s works, <abbr title="page 37">p. xxxvii</abbr>)</cite>
throws doubt upon Walter’s whole account
of her except her name, and suggests that she may have belonged to a knightly
family of <i>Akeny</i> (i.e. Acquigny) in Normandy. This, however, is a question to
be investigated by a biographer of Geoffrey or a student of his later political
career rather than by an historian of the Angevin kings. The doubts which <abbr title="Walter">W.</abbr>
Map tries to throw upon his connexion with them are probably affected, and clearly
unfounded. Few specimens of the Angevin race are more unmistakeable than
Geoffrey; one might perhaps add, few more creditable.

<p>Eleanor’s mission to Rome succeeded. Geoffrey’s election
and his claim to the obedience of the bishop of Durham
were both confirmed by Pope Celestine;<a id="Anchor_1524" href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1524.">[1524]</a> he was consecrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">ii.305</a></span>
at Tours by Archbishop Bartholomew on August 18, and
received his pall on the same day.<a id="Anchor_1525" href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1525.">[1525]</a> He at once put himself in
communication with John, to secure a protector on his return
to his see;<a id="Anchor_1526" href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1526.">[1526]</a> for William of Longchamp, having had no notice
from Richard of the remission of Geoffrey’s vow of absence,
refused to believe in it,<a id="Anchor_1527" href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1527.">[1527]</a> and had not only issued orders for
the archbishop’s arrest as soon as he should land in England,<a id="Anchor_1528" href="#Footnote_1528" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1528.">[1528]</a>
but had agreed with the countess of Flanders that no Flemish
ship should be allowed to give him a passage. The countess,
however, evaded her agreement by letting him sail from
Wissant in an English boat.<a id="Anchor_1529" href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1529.">[1529]</a> He landed at Dover on Holy
Cross day,<a id="Anchor_1530" href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1530.">[1530]</a> having changed his clothes to avoid recognition.<a id="Anchor_1531" href="#Footnote_1531" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1531.">[1531]</a>
The constable of Dover, Matthew de Clères, was absent; his
wife Richenda was a sister of William of Longchamp; her
men-at-arms surrounded the archbishop the moment he
touched the shore, recognized him in spite of his disguise,
and strove to arrest him, but he managed to free himself
from their hands and make his way to the priory of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin,
just outside the town. Here for five days Richenda’s
followers vainly endeavoured to blockade and starve him
into surrender.<a id="Anchor_1532" href="#Footnote_1532" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1532.">[1532]</a> On the fifth day a band of armed men
rushed into the priory-church, and in the chancellor’s name
ordered Geoffrey to quit the country at once. Geoffrey,
seated by the altar, clad in his pontifical robes and with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">ii.306</a></span>
archiepiscopal cross in his hand, set them and their chancellor
at defiance.<a id="Anchor_1533" href="#Footnote_1533" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1533.">[1533]</a> They dragged him out of the church by the
hands and feet; and as nothing would induce him to mount
a horse which they brought for him, they dragged him on,
still in the same array, still clinging to his cross and excommunicating
them as they went, all through the town to the
castle, where they flung him into prison.<a id="Anchor_1534" href="#Footnote_1534" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1534.">[1534]</a></p>

<p>This outrage roused up all parties alike in Church and
state. England had had quite enough of persecuted and
martyred archbishops. Protests and remonstrances came
pouring in upon the chancellor from the most opposite
quarters<span class="nobreak">:—</span>from the treasurer and bishop of London, Richard
Fitz-Nigel<a id="Anchor_1535" href="#Footnote_1535" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1535.">[1535]</a>—from the aged bishop of Norwich, John of
Oxford,<a id="Anchor_1536" href="#Footnote_1536" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1536.">[1536]</a> and from the Canterbury chapter,<a id="Anchor_1537" href="#Footnote_1537" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1537.">[1537]</a> both of whom
had had only too much experience, in different ways, of the
disasters which might result from such violence to an archbishop.
The most venerated of living English prelates,
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Hugh of Lincoln, at once excommunicated Richenda, her
husband and all her abettors, with lighted candles at Oxford.<a id="Anchor_1538" href="#Footnote_1538" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1538.">[1538]</a>
John remonstrated most vehemently of all,<a id="Anchor_1539" href="#Footnote_1539" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1539.">[1539]</a> and his remonstrances
procured Geoffrey’s release,<a id="Anchor_1540" href="#Footnote_1540" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1540.">[1540]</a> but only on condition
that he would go straight to London and there remain till
the case between him and the chancellor could be tried by
an assembly of bishops and barons.<a id="Anchor_1541" href="#Footnote_1541" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1541.">[1541]</a> This of course satisfied
nobody. John had no mind to lose his opportunity of
crushing his enemy once for all. From Lancaster, where he
was laying his plans with the help of Bishop Hugh of
Coventry—a nephew of the old arch-plotter Arnulf of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">ii.307</a></span>
Lisieux—he hurried to Marlborough, and thence sent out
summons to all the great men whom he thought likely to
help him against the chancellor. He was not disappointed.
The co-justiciars hastened up from the various shires where
they were apparently busy with their judicial or financial
visitations—William the Marshal from Gloucestershire, William
Bruère from Oxfordshire, Geoffrey Fitz-Peter from
Northamptonshire; the bishops were represented by Godfrey
of Winchester and Reginald of Bath, and the sovereign himself
by Walter of Rouen; <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Hugh of Lincoln joined the
train as it passed through Oxford to Reading. From
Reading John sent to call his half-brother to his side.
Geoffrey, who was beginning to be looked upon and to
look upon himself as something like another <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas,
had made a sort of triumphal progress from Dover to
London; tied by his parole, he was obliged to ask the
chancellor’s consent to his acceptance of John’s invitation,
and only gained it on condition of returning within a given
time.<a id="Anchor_1542" href="#Footnote_1542" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1542.">[1542]</a></p>

<p>The chancellor meanwhile was at Norwich;<a id="Anchor_1543" href="#Footnote_1543" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1543.">[1543]</a> and thither
John and the justiciars had already sent him a summons to
appear before them and answer for his conduct towards both
Geoffrey of York and Hugh of Durham, at an assembly to
be held at the bridge over the Lodden, between Reading
and Windsor, on Saturday October 5.<a id="Anchor_1544" href="#Footnote_1544" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1544.">[1544]</a> William retorted by
a counter-summons to all who had joined the count of Mortain
to forsake him as an usurper and return to their obedience
to the king’s chosen representative.<a id="Anchor_1545" href="#Footnote_1545" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1545.">[1545]</a> He hurried,
however, to Windsor in time for the proposed meeting; but
when the Saturday morning came, the earls of Arundel,
Warren and Norfolk appeared at the trysting-place in his
stead, pleading ill-health as an excuse for his absence.<a id="Anchor_1546" href="#Footnote_1546" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1546.">[1546]</a> As
Saturday was accounted an unlucky day for contracts or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">ii.308</a></span>
settlements of any kind,<a id="Anchor_1547" href="#Footnote_1547" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1547.">[1547]</a> no one regretted the delay; John
and the barons, sitting amid a ring of spectators in the
meadows by the Lodden, spent the day in discussing all the
complaints against the chancellor, and also, apparently, in
looking through such of the Norman primate’s bundle of
royal letters as he chose to shew them, and deliberating
which would be most appropriate to the present state of
affairs. On one point all were agreed; the chancellor must
be put down at once.<a id="Anchor_1548" href="#Footnote_1548" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1548.">[1548]</a> Early next morning he tried to
bribe John into reconciliation, but in vain.<a id="Anchor_1549" href="#Footnote_1549" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1549.">[1549]</a> At the high
mass in Reading parish church the whole body of bishops
lighted their candles and publicly excommunicated all who
had been, whether by actual participation, command or
consent, concerned in Archbishop Geoffrey’s arrest;<a id="Anchor_1550" href="#Footnote_1550" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1550.">[1550]</a> and at
nightfall the chancellor was compelled to swear that, come
what might, he would be ready to stand his trial at the
bridge of Lodden on the morrow.<a id="Anchor_1551" href="#Footnote_1551" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1551.">[1551]</a></p>

<p>Scarcely had he set out on the Monday morning when
he was met by a report that his enemies were marching upon
London.<a id="Anchor_1552" href="#Footnote_1552" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1552.">[1552]</a> The report was true in substance; John and the
barons, instead of waiting for him at the Lodden bridge,
crossed it, and then divided their forces into two bodies; the
smaller, consisting of the bishops and barons with John himself,
proceeded towards Windsor to meet the chancellor; the
larger, comprising the men-at-arms and the servants in charge
of the baggage, was sent on by the southern road to Staines.<a id="Anchor_1553" href="#Footnote_1553" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1553.">[1553]</a>
Such a movement was quite enough to justify William in
hurrying back to Windsor and thence on to London as fast as
horses could carry him.<a id="Anchor_1554" href="#Footnote_1554" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1554.">[1554]</a> Before he could reach it he met<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">ii.309</a></span>
John’s men-at-arms coming up by the other road from Staines;
a skirmish took place, in which John’s justiciar Roger de
Planes was mortally wounded, but his followers seem to have
had the best of the fight,<a id="Anchor_1555" href="#Footnote_1555" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1555.">[1555]</a> although they could not prevent
the chancellor from making his way safe into London. Here
he at once called a meeting of the citizens in the Guildhall,
and endeavoured to secure their support against John.<a id="Anchor_1556" href="#Footnote_1556" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1556.">[1556]</a> He
found, however, a strong party opposed to himself. On the
last day of July<a id="Anchor_1557" href="#Footnote_1557" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1557.">[1557]</a>—three days after the second award between
John and William at Winchester—the citizens of London
had profited by the king’s absence and his representative’s
humiliation to set up a <i>commune</i>. They knew very well that,
as a contemporary writer says, neither King Henry nor
King Richard would have sanctioned such a thing at any
price;<a id="Anchor_1558" href="#Footnote_1558" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1558.">[1558]</a> and they knew even better still that Richard’s chancellor
would never countenance it for a moment. With John
they might have a chance, and they were not disposed to
lose it by shutting their gates in his face at the bidding of
William of Longchamp. William, seeing that his cause was
lost in the city, shut himself up in the Tower.<a id="Anchor_1559" href="#Footnote_1559" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1559.">[1559]</a></p>

<p>By this time John and his companions were at the gates;
a short parley ended in their admittance.<a id="Anchor_1560" href="#Footnote_1560" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1560.">[1560]</a> Next morning
barons and citizens came together in <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Paul’s.<a id="Anchor_1561" href="#Footnote_1561" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1561.">[1561]</a>. One after
another the chancellor’s victims, with the archbishop of York
at their head, set forth their grievances.<a id="Anchor_1562" href="#Footnote_1562" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1562.">[1562]</a> Archbishop Walter
of Rouen and William the Marshal then produced the king’s
letter of February 20, addressed to the Marshal, and accrediting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">ii.310</a></span>
Walter to him and his fellow-justiciars, and bidding them,
in case of any failure of duty on the chancellor’s part, follow
Walter’s direction in all things.<a id="Anchor_1563" href="#Footnote_1563" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1563.">[1563]</a> John and the barons agreed
to act in accordance with these instructions; they won the
assent of the citizens by swearing to maintain the commune;<a id="Anchor_1564" href="#Footnote_1564" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1564.">[1564]</a>
the whole assembly then swore fealty to Richard, and to John as
his destined successor.<a id="Anchor_1565" href="#Footnote_1565" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1565.">[1565]</a> According to one account they went
a step further: they appointed John regent of the kingdom,
and granted him the disposal of all the royal castles except
three, which were to be left to the chancellor.<a id="Anchor_1566" href="#Footnote_1566" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1566.">[1566]</a> Upon the
latter they now set out to enforce their decision at the sword’s
point. His forces were more than sufficient to defend the
Tower; they were in fact too numerous; they had had no
time to revictual the place, they were painfully overcrowded,
and before twenty-four hours were over they found their
position untenable.<a id="Anchor_1567" href="#Footnote_1567" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1567.">[1567]</a> On the Wednesday William tried to
bribe John into abandoning the whole enterprise, and he very
nearly succeeded; Geoffrey of York and Hugh of Coventry,
however, discovered what was going on, and remonstrated so
loudly that John was obliged to drop the negotiation and
continue the siege.<a id="Anchor_1568" href="#Footnote_1568" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1568.">[1568]</a> In the afternoon, at the chancellor’s
own request, four bishops and four earls went to speak with
him in the Tower.<a id="Anchor_1569" href="#Footnote_1569" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1569.">[1569]</a> Five days of intense excitement had so
exhausted his feeble frame that when they told him what
had passed at the meeting on the previous day, he dropped
senseless at their feet, and when brought to himself could at
first do nothing but implore their sympathy and mediation.<a id="Anchor_1570" href="#Footnote_1570" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1570.">[1570]</a>
The brutal insolence of Hugh of Coventry,<a id="Anchor_1571" href="#Footnote_1571" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1571.">[1571]</a> however, seems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">ii.311</a></span>
to have stung him into his wonted boldness again. With
flashing eyes he told them that the day of reckoning was
yet to come, when they and their new lord would have
to account for their treason with Richard himself; and he
sent them away with a positive refusal to surrender either
his castles or his seal.<a id="Anchor_1572" href="#Footnote_1572" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1572.">[1572]</a> Late at night, however, as he
lay vainly endeavouring to gain a little rest, his friends
came and implored him to abandon the useless struggle
with fate; and at last his brother Osbert and some others
wrung from him an unwilling permission to go and
offer themselves as hostages for his submission on the
morrow.<a id="Anchor_1573" href="#Footnote_1573" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1573.">[1573]</a></p>

<p>On the Thursday morning the barons assembled in the
fields east of the Tower,<a id="Anchor_1574" href="#Footnote_1574" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1574.">[1574]</a> and there William of Longchamp
went forth to meet them. The instant he appeared Hugh of
Coventry stepped forward, recited the whole indictment
against him, and pronounced with brutal bluntness the sentence
of the assembly.<a id="Anchor_1575" href="#Footnote_1575" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1575.">[1575]</a> William was to be deposed from
all secular authority, to keep nothing but his bishopric and
the castles of Dover, Cambridge and Hereford; he must give
hostages for his future good behaviour; then let him begone
wherever he would. The assembly broke into a chorus of
approval which seemed intended to give William no chance
of reply; but his dauntless spirit had by this time regained
its mastery over his physical weakness; he stood quietly till
they had all talked themselves out, and then they had to
listen in their turn. He denied every one of the charges
against him; he refused to recognize either the moral justice
or the legal validity of his deposition; he agreed to surrender
the castles, because he no longer had power to hold them,
but he still lifted up his protest, as King Richard’s lawful
chancellor and justiciar, against all the proceedings and the
very existence of the new ministry.<a id="Anchor_1576" href="#Footnote_1576" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1576.">[1576]</a> Walter of Rouen was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">ii.312</a></span>
at once proclaimed justiciar in his stead.<a id="Anchor_1577" href="#Footnote_1577" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1577.">[1577]</a> The keys of the
Tower and of Windsor castle, and the hostages, were delivered
up next morning, and William was then allowed to withdraw
to Bermondsey, whence on the following day he proceeded to
Dover.<a id="Anchor_1578" href="#Footnote_1578" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1578.">[1578]</a> Thence, apparently in a desperate hope that his
men might yet be able to hold the castles till he could gather
means to relieve them, he twice attempted to escape over sea,
first in the disguise of a monk, then in that of a pedlar-woman.
His lameness, however, and his ignorance of
English were fatal to his chances of flight; he was detected,
dragged back into the town, and shut up in prison till all the
castles were surrendered. Then he was set at liberty, and
sailed for Gaul on October 29.<a id="Anchor_1579" href="#Footnote_1579" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1579.">[1579]</a></p>

<p>His opponents, however, were not rid of him yet. The
king was now practically out of reach of his remonstrances
and appeals for succour;<a id="Anchor_1580" href="#Footnote_1580" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1580.">[1580]</a> but the Pope was not. William
was a bishop; and the harshness with which he had been
treated enabled him now to pose in his turn as a consecrated
victim of profane violence. Celestine <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> warmly took up
his cause; he distinctly acknowledged him as legate, whether
with or without a formal renewal of his commission;<a id="Anchor_1581" href="#Footnote_1581" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1581.">[1581]</a> and
on December 2 he issued a brief addressed to the English
bishops, bidding them excommunicate all who had
taken part in William’s deposition, and put their lands under
interdict till he should be reinstated.<a id="Anchor_1582" href="#Footnote_1582" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1582.">[1582]</a> William, as legate,
followed this up by excommunicating twenty-six of his chief
enemies by name, with the archbishop of Rouen at their head,
and, with the Pope’s sanction, threatening to treat John in
like manner, if he did not amend before Quinquagesima.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">ii.313</a></span><a id="Anchor_1583" href="#Footnote_1583" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1583.">[1583]</a>
The bishops, however, took no notice of his letters, and
the justiciars retorted by sequestrating his see;<a id="Anchor_1584" href="#Footnote_1584" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1584.">[1584]</a> they all
held him bound by the sentences pronounced against him at
Reading and at London for his persecution of Geoffrey of
York, and their view was upheld by the suffragans of Rouen,
who all treated him as excommunicate.<a id="Anchor_1585" href="#Footnote_1585" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1585.">[1585]</a> Geoffrey was now
the highest ecclesiastical authority in England; but he was
not the man to rule the English Church. He had more
than enough to do in ruling his own chief suffragan. As

<p>Richard’s continental dominions had thus far been at
peace—a peace doubly secured by the presence of Eleanor
and the absence of Philip of France. Shortly before Christmas
1191, however, Philip returned to his kingdom.<a id="Anchor_1591" href="#Footnote_1591" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1591.">[1591]</a> In
January 1192 he called the seneschal and barons of Normandy
to a conference, and demanded from them, on the
strength of a document which he shewed to them as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">ii.314</a></span>
treaty made between himself and Richard at Messina, the
restitution of his sister Adela and her dower-castles in the
Vexin, as well as the counties of Eu and Aumale. The seneschal,
rightly suspecting the paper to be a forgery, answered
that he had no instructions from Richard on the subject,
and would give up neither the lands nor the lady.<a id="Anchor_1592" href="#Footnote_1592" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1592.">[1592]</a> Philip
threatened war, and all Richard’s constables prepared for
defence.<a id="Anchor_1593" href="#Footnote_1593" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1593.">[1593]</a> Meanwhile, Philip offered to John the investiture
of all Richard’s continental dominions, if he would accept
Adela’s hand with them.<a id="Anchor_1594" href="#Footnote_1594" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1594.">[1594]</a> That John had a wife already
was an obstacle which troubled neither the French king nor
John himself. He was quite ready to accept the offer; but
meanwhile it reached his mother’s ears, and she hurried to
England to stop him.<a id="Anchor_1595" href="#Footnote_1595" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1595.">[1595]</a> Landing at Portsmouth on Quinquagesima
Sunday,<a id="Anchor_1596" href="#Footnote_1596" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1596.">[1596]</a> she found him on the point of embarking;
the archbishop of Rouen and the other justiciars gladly welcomed
her back to her former post of regent, and joined
with her in forbidding John to leave the country, under
penalty of having all his estates seized in the king’s name.<a id="Anchor_1597" href="#Footnote_1597" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1597.">[1597]</a>
They then held a series of councils, at Windsor, Oxford,
London and Winchester;<a id="Anchor_1598" href="#Footnote_1598" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1598.">[1598]</a> in that of London the barons
renewed their oath of fealty to the king, but to pacify John
they were obliged to do the like to him as heir,<a id="Anchor_1599" href="#Footnote_1599" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1599.">[1599]</a> and the
immediate consequence was that he persuaded the constables
of Windsor and Wallingford to surrender their castles into
his hands.<a id="Anchor_1600" href="#Footnote_1600" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1600.">[1600]</a> William of Longchamp thought his opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">ii.315</a></span>
had come. He managed to gain Eleanor’s ear and to bribe
John;<a id="Anchor_1601" href="#Footnote_1601" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1601.">[1601]</a> both connived at his return to Dover, and thence he
sent up his demand for restoration to a council gathered in
London towards the close of Lent.<a id="Anchor_1602" href="#Footnote_1602" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1602.">[1602]</a> It seems plain that he
had won the favour of the queen; for the justiciars, whose
original purpose in meeting had been to discuss the misdoings
of John, now saw themselves obliged to fetch John
himself from Wallingford to support them, as they expected,
in their resistance to the chancellor’s demands. To their
dismay John told them plainly that he was on the point of
making alliance with his old enemy for a consideration of
seven hundred pounds.<a id="Anchor_1603" href="#Footnote_1603" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1603.">[1603]</a> They saw that their only chance
was to outbid William. They gave John two thousand
marks out of the royal treasury;<a id="Anchor_1604" href="#Footnote_1604" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1604.">[1604]</a> Walter of Rouen helped
to persuade the queen-mother,<a id="Anchor_1605" href="#Footnote_1605" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1605.">[1605]</a> and the chancellor was
bidden to depart out of the land.<a id="Anchor_1606" href="#Footnote_1606" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1606.">[1606]</a></p>

It is
certain that Philip told and acted a downright lie; for the treaty of Messina is
extant, and its main provisions are these: Richard shall be bound to surrender
Adela only within one month after his own return to Gaul, and the whole Norman
Vexin, including its castles, shall remain to him and his heirs male for ever. Only
in case of his death without male heir is it to revert to the French Crown; and as
for Aumale and Eu, there is not a word about them.

the betrayal of
these castles is placed a year later. Roger’s account of the first few months of
1193 has, however, somewhat the look of a repetition of the history of 1192, and
his story is much less consistent and circumstantial than Richard’s, which I have
therefore ventured to follow.

<p>Shortly afterwards, two cardinal-legates arrived in France
to settle his dispute with the archbishop of Rouen. When
they attempted to enter Normandy, the seneschal refused
them admittance and shut the gates of Gisors in their faces,
pleading that the subjects of an English king were forbidden
by ancient custom to admit legates into any part of his
dominions without his consent. The legates on this excommunicated
the seneschal and laid all Normandy under interdict.<a id="Anchor_1607" href="#Footnote_1607" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1607.">[1607]</a>
William had done the same to his own diocese before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">ii.316</a></span>
leaving England.<a id="Anchor_1608" href="#Footnote_1608" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1608.">[1608]</a> Archbishop Walter, the English justiciars,
even the queen-mother, were all at their wits’ end: Philip
was openly threatening to invade the Norman duchy; the
obstacle which had prevented him until now—the unwillingness
of the French barons to attack the territories of a
crusader<a id="Anchor_1609" href="#Footnote_1609" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1609.">[1609]</a>—would be considerably lessened by the interdict;
the only person who could be found in England capable of
undertaking a negotiation with the legates was Hugh of
Durham; but Hugh declined to go till his own quarrel with
his metropolitan was settled,<a id="Anchor_1610" href="#Footnote_1610" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1610.">[1610]</a> and this was not accomplished
till the middle of October.<a id="Anchor_1611" href="#Footnote_1611" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1611.">[1611]</a> Then indeed he went to France,
and succeeded in obtaining the removal of the interdict.<a id="Anchor_1612" href="#Footnote_1612" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1612.">[1612]</a>
But in other quarters the prospect grew no brighter. Aquitaine,
held in check for a while by the presence of its
duchess, had risen as soon as she was out of reach. Count
Ademar of Angoulême marched into Poitou with a large
body of horse and foot; taken prisoner by the Poitevins, he
appealed to the French king for deliverance.<a id="Anchor_1613" href="#Footnote_1613" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1613.">[1613]</a> A revolt of
the Gascon barons was with difficulty suppressed by the
seneschal, assisted by young Sancho of Navarre,<a id="Anchor_1614" href="#Footnote_1614" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1614.">[1614]</a> brother of
Richard’s queen; and the victors rashly followed up their
success by a raid upon Toulouse, which, though it went
unpunished for the moment, could only lead to further mischief.<a id="Anchor_1615" href="#Footnote_1615" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1615.">[1615]</a>
In England John was still defying the justiciars;
and they dared not proceed to extremities with him, for
they now saw before them an imminent prospect of having
to acknowledge him as their king.</p>

<p>Richard’s adventures in the East lie outside the sphere
of English history. The crusade of which he was the chief
hero and leader had indirectly an important effect upon
English social life; but it was in no sense a national undertaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">ii.317</a></span>;
every man in the host was, like the king himself,
simply a volunteer, not sent out by his country or representing
it in any way. Richard’s glory is all his own; to us,
the practical interest of the crusade in which he won it consists
in the light which it throws upon his character, and on
his political relations with the other princes who took part
in the enterprise. The story, as it comes out bit by bit,
oddly intermingled with the dry details of home affairs, in
the English historians of the time, and as it is told at full
length in the “Itinerary” composed by one of his fellow-crusaders,
reads more like an old wiking-saga than a piece of
sober history, and its hero looks more like a comrade of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Olaf
or Harald Hardrada than a contemporary of Philip Augustus.
Nothing indeed except Richard’s northman-blood can account
for the intense love of the sea, and the consummate seamanship,
as sound and practical as it was brilliant and daring, which he
displayed on his outward voyage. No sea-king of old ever
guided his little squadron of “long keels” more boldly, more
skilfully and more successfully through a more overwhelming
succession of difficulties and perils than those through which
Richard guided his large and splendid fleet on its way from
Messina to Acre.<a id="Anchor_1616" href="#Footnote_1616" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1616.">[1616]</a> Not one had ever made a conquest at
once as rapid, as valuable and as complete as the conquest
of Cyprus, which Richard made in a few days, as a mere
episode in his voyage, in vengeance for the ill-treatment
which some of his ship-wrecked sailors had met with at the
hands of the Cypriots and their king.<a id="Anchor_1617" href="#Footnote_1617" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1617.">[1617]</a> But it was a mere
wiking-conquest; Richard never dreamed of permanently
adding this remote island to the list of his dominions;
within a few months he sold it to the Templars,<a id="Anchor_1618" href="#Footnote_1618" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1618.">[1618]</a> and afterwards,
as they failed to take possession, he made it over to
the dethroned king of Jerusalem who had helped him to
conquer it, Guy of Lusignan.<a id="Anchor_1619" href="#Footnote_1619" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1619.">[1619]</a> The same love of adventure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">ii.318</a></span>
for its own sake colours many of his exploits in the Holy
Land itself. But there we learn, too, that his character had
yet another and a higher aspect. We find in him, side by
side with the reckless northern valour, the northern endurance,
patience and self-restraint, coupled with a real disinterestedness
and a self-sacrificing generosity for which it would be
somewhat hard to find a parallel among his forefathers on
either side.<a id="Anchor_1620" href="#Footnote_1620" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1620.">[1620]</a> Alike in a military, a political and a moral
point of view, Richard is the only one among the leaders of
the crusading host, except Guy, who comes out of the ordeal
with a character not merely unstained, but shining with
redoubled lustre. And this alone would almost account for
the fact that, before they separated, nearly every one of
them, save Guy, had become Richard’s open or secret foe.</p>

<p>Envy of a better man than themselves was however not
the sole cause of their hostility. The office of commander-in-chief
of the host fell to Richard’s share in consequence of
a catastrophe which altered the whole balance of political
parties in Europe. That office had been destined for the
Emperor Frederic Barbarossa, who for more than thirty
years had stood as high above all other Christian princes in
political capacity, military prowess, and personal nobility of
character, as in titular dignity and territorial power. Frederic
set out for Palestine as early as May 1189;<a id="Anchor_1621" href="#Footnote_1621" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1621.">[1621]</a> he fought his
way through the treacheries of the Greek Emperor and the
ambushes of the Turkish sultan of Iconium, only to be
drowned in crossing a little river in Asia Minor on June 10,
1190.<a id="Anchor_1622" href="#Footnote_1622" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1622.">[1622]</a> These tidings probably met Richard on his arrival
at Messina in September. There he had to deal with the
consequences of another death which had occurred in the
previous November, that of his brother-in-law King William
of Sicily.<a id="Anchor_1623" href="#Footnote_1623" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1623.">[1623]</a> William was childless; after a vain attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">ii.319</a></span>
induce his father-in-law Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> to accept the reversion
of his crown,<a id="Anchor_1624" href="#Footnote_1624" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1624.">[1624]</a> he had bequeathed it to his own young aunt
Constance, who was married to Henry of Germany, the
Emperor’s eldest son.<a id="Anchor_1625" href="#Footnote_1625" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1625.">[1625]</a> It was, however, seized by Tancred,
a cousin of the late king.<a id="Anchor_1626" href="#Footnote_1626" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1626.">[1626]</a> Richard’s alliance with Tancred,
though on the one hand absolutely necessary to secure the
co-operation of Sicily for the crusade, was thus on the other
a mortal offence to the new king of Germany, who moreover
had already a grudge against England upon another ground<span class="nobreak">:—</span>Henry
the Lion had in this very summer extorted from
him almost at the sword’s point his restoration to his forfeited
estates.<a id="Anchor_1627" href="#Footnote_1627" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1627.">[1627]</a> Thus when Richard at last reached Acre in June
1191,<a id="Anchor_1628" href="#Footnote_1628" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1628.">[1628]</a> he was already in ill odour with the leaders of the
German contingent, the Emperor’s brother Duke Frederic of
Suabia and his cousin Duke Leopold of Austria.</p>

<p>This, however, was not all. Isaac, the tyrant of Cyprus,
whom Richard had brought with him as a captive, was
also connected with the Suabian and Austrian houses;<a id="Anchor_1629" href="#Footnote_1629" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1629.">[1629]</a>
his capture was another ground of offence. Next, when
the siege of Acre, which the united forces of eastern and
western Christendom had been pressing in vain for nearly
two years, came to an end a month after Richard joined it,<a id="Anchor_1630" href="#Footnote_1630" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1630.">[1630]</a>
Richard and Leopold quarrelled over their shares in the
honour of the victory; Leopold—so the story goes—set up
his banner on the wall of the conquered town side by side
with that of the English king, and Richard tore it down
again.<a id="Anchor_1631" href="#Footnote_1631" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1631.">[1631]</a> Besides all this, as Richard’s superior military
capacity made him an object of perpetual jealousy to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">ii.320</a></span>
other princes, so his policy in Holy Land was in direct
opposition to theirs. Since the death of Queen Sibyl in
October 1189,<a id="Anchor_1632" href="#Footnote_1632" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1632.">[1632]</a> they had one and all aimed at transferring the
crown from her childless widower Guy of Lusignan to the
lord of Tyre, Conrad, marquis of Montferrat. Montferrat
was an important fief of the kingdom of Italy; Conrad’s
mother was aunt both to Leopold of Austria and to Frederic
Barbarossa;<a id="Anchor_1633" href="#Footnote_1633" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1633.">[1633]</a> he thus had the whole Austrian and imperial
influence at his back; and that of Philip of France was
thrown into the same scale, simply because Richard had
espoused the opposite cause. Guy of Lusignan, with a fearlessness
which speaks volumes in his favour as well as in
Richard’s, had thrown himself unreservedly on the generosity
and justice of the prince against whom all his race had for
so many years been struggling in Aquitaine; his confidence
was met as it deserved, and from the hour of their meeting
in Cyprus to the break-up of the crusade, Richard and Guy
stood firmly side by side. But they stood alone amid the
ring of selfish politicians who supported Conrad, and whose
intrigues brought ruin upon the expedition. Philip, indeed,
went home as soon as Acre was won, to sow the seeds of
mischief in a field where they were likely to bring forth a
more profitable harvest for his interests than on the barren
soil of Palestine. But the whole body of French crusaders
whom he left behind him, except Count Henry of Champagne<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">ii.321</a></span>,
made common cause with the Germans and the
partizans of Conrad in thwarting every scheme that Richard
proposed, either for the settlement of the Frank kingdom in
Palestine or for the reconquest of its capital. Twice he led
the host within eight miles of Jerusalem, and twice, when
thus close to the goal, he was compelled to turn away.<a id="Anchor_1634" href="#Footnote_1634" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1634.">[1634]</a>
Conrad fell by the hand of an assassin in April 1192;<a id="Anchor_1635" href="#Footnote_1635" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1635.">[1635]</a> but
Guy’s cause, like that of Jerusalem itself, was lost beyond
recovery; all that Richard could do for either was to compensate
Guy with the gift of Cyprus,<a id="Anchor_1636" href="#Footnote_1636" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1636.">[1636]</a> and sanction the transfer
of the shadowy crown of Jerusalem to his own nephew,
Henry of Champagne.<a id="Anchor_1637" href="#Footnote_1637" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1637.">[1637]</a> Harassed by evil tidings from
England and forebodings of mischief in Gaul, disappointed
in his most cherished hopes and worn out with fruitless
labour, sick in body and more sick at heart, he saw that his
only chance of ever again striking a successful blow either
for east or west was to go home at once. After one last
brilliant exploit, the rescue of Joppa from the Turks who
had seized it in his absence,<a id="Anchor_1638" href="#Footnote_1638" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1638.">[1638]</a> on September 2 he made a
truce with Saladin for three years;<a id="Anchor_1639" href="#Footnote_1639" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1639.">[1639]</a> on October 9 he sailed
from Acre.<a id="Anchor_1640" href="#Footnote_1640" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1640.">[1640]</a></p>

<p>Stormy winds had again parted the king’s ship from the
rest of his fleet when, within three days’ sail of Marseille, he
learned that Count Raymond of Toulouse was preparing to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">ii.322</a></span>
seize him on his landing,<a id="Anchor_1641" href="#Footnote_1641" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1641.">[1641]</a> no doubt in vengeance for the
attack made upon Toulouse a few months before by the
seneschal of Gascony. Capture by Raymond meant betrayal
to Philip of France, and Richard knew Philip far
too well to run any needless risk of falling into his hands.
Under more favourable conditions, he might have escaped
by sailing on through the strait of Gibraltar direct to his
island realm; but contrary winds made this impossible, and
drove him back upon Corfu, where he landed about Martinmas.<a id="Anchor_1642" href="#Footnote_1642" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1642.">[1642]</a>
Thence, in his impatience, he set off in disguise
with only twenty followers<a id="Anchor_1643" href="#Footnote_1643" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1643.">[1643]</a> on board a little pirate-vessel<a id="Anchor_1644" href="#Footnote_1644" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1644.">[1644]</a>
in which, at imminent risk of discovery, he coasted up
the Adriatic till another storm wrecked him at the head
of the Gulf of Aquileia.<a id="Anchor_1645" href="#Footnote_1645" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1645.">[1645]</a> By this time his German enemies
were all on the look-out for him, and whatever his plans on
leaving Corfu may have been, he had now no resource but to
hurry through the imperial dominions as rapidly and secretly
as possible. His geographical knowledge, however, seems to
have been at fault, for he presently found himself at Vienna,
whither Leopold of Austria had long since returned. In
spite of his efforts to disguise himself, Richard was recognized,
captured and brought before the duke;<a id="Anchor_1646" href="#Footnote_1646" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1646.">[1646]</a> and three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">ii.323</a></span>

ship, whereupon he, “for their praiseworthy fortitude and boldness,” made friends
with them, and took his passage in their company. This is authentic, for the

gives the most detailed account of the capture—an account which looks too characteristic
not to be true. According to him, Richard stopped to dine at a little
inn just outside Vienna, and to avoid recognition, set to work to broil some meat
for himself. He was holding the spit with his own hands, utterly forgetful that
one of them was adorned with a magnificent ring, when a servant of the duke
chanced to look in, noticed the incongruity, then recognized the king whom he
had seen in Palestine, and hurried off to report his discovery; whereupon the duke
came in person and seized his enemy on the spot, in the middle of his cooking.

<p>Philip at once forwarded the news to John, with a renewal
of the proposal which he had made to him a year
before. John hurried over sea and formally did homage to
the French king for all his brother’s continental dominions;
but the seneschal and barons of Normandy refused to acknowledge
the transaction, and he hastened back again to try
his luck in England.<a id="Anchor_1648" href="#Footnote_1648" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1648.">[1648]</a> There he met with no better success.

<p>The six months of tranquillity thus gained were spent in
negotiations for the king’s release. As soon as the justiciars
heard of his capture they had despatched Bishop Savaric of
Bath to treat with the Emperor, and the abbots of Boxley
and Robertsbridge to open communications, if possible, with
Richard himself;<a id="Anchor_1653" href="#Footnote_1653" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1653.">[1653]</a> this however was a difficult matter, for of
the place of his confinement nothing was known except that
it was somewhere in the Austrian dominions, and these were
to most Englishmen of that day a wholly undiscovered
country. How the captive was first found history does not
say. Tradition filled the blank with the beautiful story of
the minstrel Blondel, wandering through Europe till he
reached a castle where there was said to be a prisoner whose
name no one could tell—winning the favour of its lord and
thus gaining admittance within its walls—peering about it
on every side in a vain effort to catch a glimpse of the
mysterious captive, till at last a well-known voice, singing
“a song which they two had made between them, and which
no one knew save they alone,” fell upon his delighted ear
through the narrow prison-window whence Richard had seen
and recognized the face of his friend.<a id="Anchor_1654" href="#Footnote_1654" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1654.">[1654]</a> It may after all have
been Blondel who guided the two abbots to the spot; we
only know that they met Richard at Ochsenfurt on his way
to be delivered up on Palm Sunday to the Emperor Henry
at Speyer.<a id="Anchor_1655" href="#Footnote_1655" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1655.">[1655]</a> Thenceforth the negotiations proceeded without
intermission; but it took nearly a year to complete them.
Personal jealousy, family interest, and pride at finding himself
actually arbiter of the fate of the most illustrious living
hero in Christendom, all tempted Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> to throw as
many obstacles as possible in the way of his captive’s release.
Taking advantage of his own position as titular head of
western Christendom, he demanded satisfaction for all the
wrongs which the various princes of the Empire had received,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">ii.325</a></span>
or considered themselves to have received, at Richard’s hands,
and for all his alleged misdoings on the Crusade, from his
alliance with Tancred to the death of Conrad of Montferrat,
in which it was suggested that he had had a share.<a id="Anchor_1656" href="#Footnote_1656" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1656.">[1656]</a> Not
one of the charges would bear examination; but they served
Henry as an excuse for playing fast and loose with Richard
on the one side and Philip of France on the other, and for
making endless changes in the conditions required for
Richard’s liberation. These were ultimately fixed at a
ransom of a hundred and fifty thousand marks, the liberation
of Isaac of Cyprus, and the betrothal of Eleanor of
Britanny to a son of the Austrian duke.<a id="Anchor_1657" href="#Footnote_1657" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1657.">[1657]</a></p>

<p>The duty of superintending the collection of the ransom
and the transmission of the hostages required by the Emperor
for its payment had been at first intrusted by Richard to
his old friend and confidant, the chancellor William of Longchamp.
William, however, found it impossible to fulfil his
instructions; before the justiciars would allow him to set
foot in England at all, they made him swear to meddle with
nothing outside his immediate commission; when compelled
to meet him in council at <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Albans, Walter of Rouen
refused him the kiss of peace, and the queen-mother and
the barons all alike refused to trust him with the hostages.<a id="Anchor_1658" href="#Footnote_1658" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1658.">[1658]</a>
Prompt and vigorous measures were however taken for
raising the money. An “aid for the king’s ransom” was
one of the three regular feudal obligations, which in strict
law fell only upon the tenants-in-chivalry; but all the
knights’ fees in Richard’s whole dominions would have been
unable to furnish so large a sum as was required in his case.
In addition therefore to an aid of twenty shillings on the
knight’s fee, the justiciars imposed a wholly new tax: they
demanded a fourth part of the revenue and of the moveable
goods of every man, whether layman or clerk, throughout<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">ii.326</a></span>
the realm. Severe and unprecedented as was this demand,
it provoked no opposition, even from the clergy;<a id="Anchor_1659" href="#Footnote_1659" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1659.">[1659]</a> it had
indeed the active co-operation of the bishops, under the
direction of a new primate—Hubert Walter, the bishop of
Salisbury, who had been one of Richard’s fellow-crusaders,

The nation seems to have responded willingly to
the demands made upon it; yet the response proved inadequate,
and the deficiency had to be supplied partly by a
contribution from the Cistercians and Gilbertines of a fourth
part of the wool of the flocks which were their chief source
of revenue, and partly by confiscating the gold and silver
vessels and ornaments of the wealthier churches.<a id="Anchor_1661" href="#Footnote_1661" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1661.">[1661]</a> Similar
measures were taken in Richard’s continental dominions,
and they were so far successful that when the appointed
time arrived for his release, in January 1194, the greater
part of the ransom was paid.<a id="Anchor_1662" href="#Footnote_1662" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1662.">[1662]</a> For the remainder hostages
were given, of whom one was Archbishop Walter of Rouen.<a id="Anchor_1663" href="#Footnote_1663" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1663.">[1663]</a>
This selection left the chief justiciarship of England practically
vacant, and accordingly Richard, before summoning
the Norman primate to Germany, superseded him in that
office by bestowing it upon the new archbishop of Canterbury,
Hubert Walter.<a id="Anchor_1664" href="#Footnote_1664" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1664.">[1664]</a></p>

One <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> of Ralf has in its place that of Baldwin Wake. As Baldwin certainly

<p>The new justiciar immediately had his hands full of
trouble. At the prospect of Richard’s return John grew
half frantic with rage and dismay. As early as July 1193,
when it became known that Richard and the Emperor had
come to terms, Philip had sent warning to John—“Beware,
the devil is loose again!” and John, without stopping to
reflect that the “devil” could not be really loose till his
ransom was paid, had hurried over sea to seek shelter from
his brother’s wrath under the protection of the French king.
Richard, however, at once made overtures of reconciliation
to both;<a id="Anchor_1665" href="#Footnote_1665" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1665.">[1665]</a> the terms which he offered to John were indeed
so favourable that the Norman constables refused to execute
them, and thereby put an end to the negotiation.<a id="Anchor_1666" href="#Footnote_1666" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1666.">[1666]</a> In
January Philip and John made a last effort to bribe the
Emperor either to keep Richard in custody for another year,
or actually to sell him into their hands.<a id="Anchor_1667" href="#Footnote_1667" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1667.">[1667]</a> When this failed,
John in the frenzy of desperation sent a confidential clerk
over to England with letters to his adherents there, bidding
them make all his castles ready for defence against the king.
The messenger’s foolish boasting, however, betrayed him as
he passed through London; he was arrested by order of the
mayor, his letters were seized, and a council was hurriedly
called to hear their contents. Its prompt and vigorous
measures were clearly due to the initiative of the new
justiciar-archbishop. John was excommunicated and declared
disseized of all his English tenements, and the
assembly broke up to execute its own decree by force of
arms. The old bishop of Durham returned to his siege of
Tickhill; the earls of Huntingdon, Chester and Ferrers led
their forces against Nottingham; Archbishop Hubert himself
besieged Marlborough, and took it in a few days; Lancaster
was given up to him by its constable, who happened
to be his own brother; and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Michael’s Mount in Cornwall—a
monastery whose site, not unlike that of its great Norman
namesake, had tempted one of John’s partizans to
drive out the monks and fortify it in his interest—surrendered
on the death of its commander, who is said to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">ii.328</a></span>
died of terror at the news of the king’s approach.<a id="Anchor_1668" href="#Footnote_1668" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1668.">[1668]</a> Richard
had been set free on February 4.<a id="Anchor_1669" href="#Footnote_1669" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1669.">[1669]</a> After a slow progress
through Germany and the Low Countries, he embarked at
Swine, near Antwerp, and landed at Sandwich on March 13.<a id="Anchor_1670" href="#Footnote_1670" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1670.">[1670]</a>
Following the invariable practice of his father, he hastened
first to the martyr’s shrine at Canterbury;<a id="Anchor_1671" href="#Footnote_1671" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1671.">[1671]</a> next day he
was met by the victorious archbishop hastening to welcome
him home,<a id="Anchor_1672" href="#Footnote_1672" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1672.">[1672]</a> and three days later he was solemnly received
in London.<a id="Anchor_1673" href="#Footnote_1673" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1673.">[1673]</a> As soon as the defenders of Tickhill were
certified of his arrival they surrendered to the bishop of
Durham.<a id="Anchor_1674" href="#Footnote_1674" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1674.">[1674]</a> As Windsor, Wallingford and the Peak had been
in the queen-mother’s custody since the truce of May 1193,<a id="Anchor_1675" href="#Footnote_1675" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1675.">[1675]</a>
only Nottingham now remained to be won. Richard at
once marched against it with all his forces; the archbishop
followed, Hugh of Durham brought up his men from Tickhill;
in three days the castle surrendered, and Richard was
once again undisputed master in his realm.<a id="Anchor_1676" href="#Footnote_1676" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1676.">[1676]</a></p>

<p>It must have seemed, to say the least, an ungracious
return for the sacrifices which England had made in his
behalf, when the king at once demanded from the English
knighthood the services of a third of their number to accompany
him into Normandy, from the freeholders a contribution
of two shillings on every carucate of land, and from the
Cistercians the whole of their wool for the current year.<a id="Anchor_1677" href="#Footnote_1677" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1677.">[1677]</a>
In view of a war with France, of which it was impossible to
calculate either the exigencies or the duration, Richard
undoubtedly needed money; but his needs pressed heavily
upon a country which had already been almost drained to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">ii.329</a></span>
provide his ransom. In justice to him, it must however be
added that the “carucage,” as the new land-tax came to be
called, seems to have been levied not for his personal profit,
but as a supplement to the measures taken by the justiciars
in the previous year, to complete the sum still due to Henry
<abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> It was in reality an old impost revived under a new
name, for the carucate or ploughland was in practice
reckoned as equivalent to the ancient hide,<a id="Anchor_1678" href="#Footnote_1678" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1678.">[1678]</a> and the sum
levied upon it was precisely that which the hide had furnished
for the Danegeld of earlier times.<a id="Anchor_1679" href="#Footnote_1679" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1679.">[1679]</a> Its re-imposition
in these circumstances, under a new appellation and for the
payment of what the whole nation regarded as a debt of
honour, met with no resistance. The Cistercians, however,
remonstrated so strongly against the demand for their wool
that they were allowed to escape with a money-compensation.<a id="Anchor_1680" href="#Footnote_1680" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1680.">[1680]</a>
The taxes were imposed in a great council held at
Nottingham at the end of March and beginning of April,<a id="Anchor_1681" href="#Footnote_1681" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1681.">[1681]</a>
where measures were also taken for the punishment of the
traitors and the reconstruction of the administrative body.
These two objects were accomplished both at once, and both
were turned to account for the replenishment of the royal
coffers. Except John, Bishop Hugh of Chester, and Gerard
de Camville, who were cited before the king’s court on a
charge of high treason,<a id="Anchor_1682" href="#Footnote_1682" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1682.">[1682]</a> none of the delinquents were even
threatened with any worse punishment than dismissal from
office. This was inflicted upon most of those who had taken
part in the proceedings against the chancellor. Several of
the sheriffs indeed were only transferred from one shire to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">ii.330</a></span>
another;<a id="Anchor_1683" href="#Footnote_1683" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1683.">[1683]</a> but Gerard de Camville was ejected without
compensation from the sheriffdom of Lincolnshire, and Hugh
Bardulf, one of the subordinate justiciars who had joined the
party of John, from those of Yorkshire and Westmoreland.
These three offices Richard at once put up for sale, and,
with a strange inconsistency, William of Longchamp, whose
well-grounded resistance to the accumulation of sheriffdoms
in episcopal hands had been the beginning of his troubles,
now sought to buy the two former, and also that of Northamptonshire,
for himself. He was however outbid by
Archbishop Geoffrey of York, who bought the sheriffdom of
Yorkshire for three thousand marks and a promise of a
hundred marks annually as increment.<a id="Anchor_1684" href="#Footnote_1684" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1684.">[1684]</a> This purchase
made Geoffrey the most influential man in the north, for
Hugh of Durham, apparently finding himself powerless to
hold Northumberland, had resigned it into the king’s hands.<a id="Anchor_1685" href="#Footnote_1685" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1685.">[1685]</a>
William of Scotland immediately opened negotiations with
Richard for its re-purchase, as well as for that of Cumberland,
Westmoreland, Lancaster, and the other English lands
held by his grandfather David. The barons, however, before
whom Richard laid the proposal in a council at Northampton,
resented it strongly; Richard’s own military instinct led him
to refuse the cession of the castles, and as William would
not be satisfied without them, the scheme came to nothing.<a id="Anchor_1686" href="#Footnote_1686" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1686.">[1686]</a></p>

<p>Richard meanwhile had been making a progress through
Mid-England,<a id="Anchor_1687" href="#Footnote_1687" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1687.">[1687]</a> similar to that which he had made before his
crowning in 1189, and ending at Winchester, where he
solemnly “wore his crown” in the cathedral church on the
first Sunday after Easter.<a id="Anchor_1688" href="#Footnote_1688" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1688.">[1688]</a> This ceremonial was in itself
merely a revival of the old regal practice which Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>
had formally abandoned in 1158; but its revival on this
occasion was prompted by other motives than Richard’s love
of pomp and shew. As a concession to the Emperor’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">ii.331</a></span>
vanity—for we can scarcely conceive any other motive—Richard
had accepted from Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> the investiture of the
kingdom of Burgundy; “over which,” says a contemporary
English writer, “be it known that the Emperor had really
no power at all,” but for which, nevertheless, he had received
Richard’s homage.<a id="Anchor_1689" href="#Footnote_1689" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1689.">[1689]</a> The homage was, of course, as empty
as the gift for which it was due; but insular pride, which
had always boasted that an English king, alone among
European sovereigns, had no superior upon earth, was offended
by it none the less; and although the story that Richard
had formally surrendered England itself into Henry’s hands
and received it back from him as a fief of the Empire<a id="Anchor_1690" href="#Footnote_1690" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1690.">[1690]</a> may
perhaps be set down as an exaggeration, still it seems to have
been felt that the majesty of the island-crown had been so
far dimmed by the transactions of his captivity as to require
a distinct re-assertion.<a id="Anchor_1691" href="#Footnote_1691" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1691.">[1691]</a> As he stood in his royal robes,
sceptre in hand and crown on head,<a id="Anchor_1692" href="#Footnote_1692" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1692.">[1692]</a> amid the throng of
bishops and barons in the “Old Minster” where so many of
his English forefathers lay sleeping, past shame was forgotten,
and England was ready once again to welcome him as a new
king.<a id="Anchor_1693" href="#Footnote_1693" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1693.">[1693]</a> But the welcome met with no response. On May 12—just
two months after his landing at Sandwich—Richard
again sailed for Normandy;<a id="Anchor_1694" href="#Footnote_1694" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1694.">[1694]</a> and this time he went to return
no more.</p>

<span class="ch2">THE LATER YEARS OF RICHARD.</span><br />

<span class="ch3">1194–1199.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> political history of England during the four years
which followed Richard’s departure over sea is simply the
history of the administration of Hubert Walter. Richard
never again interfered in the concerns of his island realm,
save for the purpose of obtaining money from it; and even
the method whereby the money was to be raised he left, like
all other details of administration, wholly to the justiciar’s
discretion. Hubert in fact, as justiciar and archbishop,
wielded during these years a power even more absolute than
that which William of Longchamp had wielded during the
king’s absence on crusade. But Richard’s second experiment
in governing England by deputy succeeded far otherwise
than the first. It was, indeed, attended with far less risk;
for the king himself was never really out of reach, and could
at any moment have returned to take up the reins of government
in person, had there been any need to do so. Moreover,
the man whom he now left as viceroy had far other
qualifications for the office than William of Longchamp.</p>

<p>Hubert Walter had been trained under the greatest
constitutional lawyer and most successful administrator of the
age, Ralf de Glanville. He was nephew to Ralf’s wife,<a id="Anchor_1695" href="#Footnote_1695" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1695.">[1695]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">ii.333</a></span>
had been a clerk or chaplain in Ralf’s household until 1186,
when he was appointed dean of York.<a id="Anchor_1696" href="#Footnote_1696" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1696.">[1696]</a> A few months later
he was one of five persons nominated by the York chapter
in answer to a royal mandate for election to the vacant see.<a id="Anchor_1697" href="#Footnote_1697" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1697.">[1697]</a>
King Henry, however, refused all five, and Hubert remained
dean of York for three years longer. He seems to have held,
besides his deanery, an office at court, either as protonotary
or as vice-chancellor under Geoffrey; for during the last few
months of Henry’s life he is found in Maine attending upon
the king, and apparently charged with the keeping of the
royal seal.<a id="Anchor_1698" href="#Footnote_1698" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1698.">[1698]</a> Consecrated to Salisbury by Archbishop Baldwin
on October 22, 1189,<a id="Anchor_1699" href="#Footnote_1699" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1699.">[1699]</a> he immediately afterwards set out
with him for Palestine; there he won universal esteem by
the zeal and ability with which he exerted himself to relieve
the wants of the poorer crusaders;<a id="Anchor_1700" href="#Footnote_1700" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1700.">[1700]</a> on Baldwin’s death
Hubert virtually succeeded to his place as the chief spiritual
authority in the host;<a id="Anchor_1701" href="#Footnote_1701" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1701.">[1701]</a> and after Richard’s arrival he made
himself no less useful as the king’s best adviser and most
trusty diplomatic agent in Palestine.<a id="Anchor_1702" href="#Footnote_1702" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1702.">[1702]</a> It was Hubert who
headed in Richard’s stead the first body of pilgrims whom
the Turks admitted to visit the Holy Sepulchre;<a id="Anchor_1703" href="#Footnote_1703" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1703.">[1703]</a> and it
seems to have been he, too, who led back the English host
from Palestine to Europe after Richard’s departure. He
hastened as early as possible to visit the king in his captivity;<a id="Anchor_1704" href="#Footnote_1704" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1704.">[1704]</a>
and Richard lost no time in sending him to England to be
made archbishop, and to help the justiciars in collecting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">ii.334</a></span>
ransom.<a id="Anchor_1705" href="#Footnote_1705" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1705.">[1705]</a> They had refused the help of William of Longchamp,
but they could not reject that of Hubert; for they
knew that, as a contemporary historian says, “the king had
no one so like-minded with himself, whose fidelity, prudence
and honesty he had proved in so many changes of fortune.”<a id="Anchor_1706" href="#Footnote_1706" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1706.">[1706]</a>
Hubert was one of the commissioners appointed to have the
custody of the ransom;<a id="Anchor_1707" href="#Footnote_1707" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1707.">[1707]</a> and there can be little doubt that
the scheme by which it was raised was in part at least
devised by his financial genius, and carried into execution
by his energy and skill—qualities which he displayed no less
effectively in dealing with the revolt which was finally quelled
by the return of Richard himself.</p>

<p>Hubert entered upon his vice-royalty—for it was nothing
less—under more favourable conditions than William of
Longchamp. He came to it not as an upstart stranger, but
as an Englishman already of high personal and official
standing, thoroughly familiar and thoroughly in sympathy
with the people whom he had to govern, intimately acquainted
with the principles and the details of the system which he
was called upon to administer; his qualifications were well
known, and they were universally acknowledged. Moreover,
there was now no one capable of heading any serious opposition
to his authority, at least in secular affairs. William of
Longchamp was still chancellor; but like the royal master
to whose side he clave for the rest of his life, he had left
England for ever. From John there was also nothing to
fear. His intended trial never took place, for he threw
himself at Richard’s feet at the first opportunity, and was
personally forgiven; but the king was wise enough to leave
untouched the sentence of forfeiture passed by the justiciar,
and to keep his brother at his own side, a dependent upon
his royal bounty, for nearly twelve months;<a id="Anchor_1708" href="#Footnote_1708" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1708.">[1708]</a> and then he
restored to him nothing but the counties of Mortain and
Gloucester and the honour of Eye, but without their castles,
giving him in compensation for the latter and for his other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">ii.335</a></span>
estates a yearly pension of eight thousand pounds Angevin.<a id="Anchor_1709" href="#Footnote_1709" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1709.">[1709]</a>
Even John’s capacities for mischief-making were so far
paralyzed by this arrangement that he seems to have made
no further attempt to meddle in English politics so long as
Richard lived. The one man in whom Hubert saw, or
fancied he saw, a possible rival on personal and ecclesiastical
grounds, he swept roughly out of his path. The two primates
had already quarrelled over the privileges of their respective
sees, and nothing but the king’s presence had availed to keep
peace between them.<a id="Anchor_1710" href="#Footnote_1710" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1710.">[1710]</a> The northern one had been at feud
with his own chapter ever since his appointment, and they
were now prosecuting an appeal against him at Rome. In
June 1194, backed, it can hardly be doubted, by Hubert’s
influence, they obtained from the Pope a sentence which
practically condemned Geoffrey without trial;<a id="Anchor_1711" href="#Footnote_1711" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1711.">[1711]</a> and before
these tidings reached England in September, a committee of
royal justices, sent by Hubert to deal with the case in its
temporal aspect, had already punished Geoffrey’s refusal to
acknowledge their jurisdiction by confiscating all his archiepiscopal
estates except Ripon.<a id="Anchor_1712" href="#Footnote_1712" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1712.">[1712]</a> He went over sea and
appealed to the king, but in vain;<a id="Anchor_1713" href="#Footnote_1713" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1713.">[1713]</a> and for the next five
years there was again but one primate in the land. One
northern bishop, however, was still ready to defy Hubert as
he had defied William of Longchamp and his own metropolitan.
When the newly appointed sheriff of Northumberland,
Hugh Bardulf, sought to enter upon his office shortly
after Richard’s departure, he found that Hugh of Durham
had already made a fresh bargain with the king, whereby he
was to retain the county on a payment of two thousand
marks. He tried, however, as before, to evade the necessity
of payment, and was in consequence forcibly disseized by
Richard’s orders.<a id="Anchor_1714" href="#Footnote_1714" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1714.">[1714]</a> Still he was unwilling to give up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">ii.336</a></span>
game; and in the spring of 1195 he made another attempt
to regain the territorial influence in the north which Geoffrey’s
fall seemed to have placed again within his reach. The
story went in Yorkshire that he actually succeeded in once
more obtaining from Richard—of course on Richard’s usual
terms—a commission as co-justiciar with Hubert.<a id="Anchor_1715" href="#Footnote_1715" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1715.">[1715]</a> Such a
commission can hardly have been given otherwise than in
mockery; yet the aged bishop, untaught by all his experience
of the king’s shifty ways, once again set out from York,
where he had just been excommunicating some of Geoffrey’s
partizans,<a id="Anchor_1716" href="#Footnote_1716" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1716.">[1716]</a> to publish his supposed triumph in London.
Sickness, however, overtook him on the way; from Doncaster
he was compelled to turn back to his old refuge at Howden,
and there on March 3 he died.<a id="Anchor_1717" href="#Footnote_1717" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1717.">[1717]</a> His palatinate was of
course taken into the custody of the royal justiciars.<a id="Anchor_1718" href="#Footnote_1718" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1718.">[1718]</a> A
fortnight later Celestine <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> sent to Archbishop Hubert a
commission as legate for all England;<a id="Anchor_1719" href="#Footnote_1719" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1719.">[1719]</a> and thenceforth he
was undisputed ruler alike in Church and state.</p>

Richard in November ordered his restoration, but the order was not carried
out; the brothers went on quarrelling, and next year Richard again declared the
archiepiscopal estates forfeited, and this time finally.

<p>Like most of the higher clergy of Henry’s later years,
Hubert was distinctly more of a statesman than a churchman.
His pontificate left no mark on the English Church;
as primate, his chief occupation was to quarrel with his
chapter. No scruples such as had moved Archbishop
Thomas to resign the chancellorship, or had made even
Bishop Roger of Salisbury seek a papal dispensation before
he would venture to undertake a lay office,<a id="Anchor_1720" href="#Footnote_1720" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1720.">[1720]</a> held back
Hubert Walter from uniting in his own person the justiciarship
and the primacy of all England. He was, however,
a statesman of the best school of the time, steeped in the
traditions of constitutional and administrative reform which
had grown up during Henry’s later years under the inspiration
of the king himself and the direction of Ralf de Glanville.
The task of developing their policy, therefore, could not have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">ii.337</a></span>
fallen to more competent hands; and as Richard was totally
destitute of his father’s business capacities, it was well that
Hubert was left to fulfil it according to his own judgement
and on his own sole responsibility for nearly four years.</p>

<p>The justiciar’s first act after his sovereign’s departure
was to despatch the judges itinerant upon their annual
visitation-tour with a commission<a id="Anchor_1721" href="#Footnote_1721" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1721.">[1721]</a> which struck the key-note
of his future policy. It was the note which had been
struck by Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> in the Assizes of Clarendon and Northampton;
but the new commission shewed a great advance
in the developement of the principles which those measures
embodied. The jurisdiction of the justices is defined with
greater fulness and extended over a much wider sphere.
The “pleas of the Crown” with which they are empowered
to deal include, besides those formerly recognized under this
head, such various matters as the number and condition of
churches in the king’s gift,<a id="Anchor_1722" href="#Footnote_1722" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1722.">[1722]</a> escheats, wardships and marriages;<a id="Anchor_1723" href="#Footnote_1723" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1723.">[1723]</a>
forgers<a id="Anchor_1724" href="#Footnote_1724" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1724.">[1724]</a> and defaulters;<a id="Anchor_1725" href="#Footnote_1725" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1725.">[1725]</a> the harbouring of malefactors;<a id="Anchor_1726" href="#Footnote_1726" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1726.">[1726]</a>
the arrears of the ransom;<a id="Anchor_1727" href="#Footnote_1727" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1727.">[1727]</a> the use of false measures;<a id="Anchor_1728" href="#Footnote_1728" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1728.">[1728]</a>
the debts of the murdered Jews; the fines due from
their slayers,<a id="Anchor_1729" href="#Footnote_1729" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1729.">[1729]</a> from the adherents of John, and from his
debtors, as well as from his own forfeited property;<a id="Anchor_1730" href="#Footnote_1730" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1730.">[1730]</a> the
disposal of the chattels of dead usurers, and also of crusaders
who had died before setting out on their pilgrimage;<a id="Anchor_1731" href="#Footnote_1731" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1731.">[1731]</a> and
the taking of recognitions under the Great Assize concerning
land worth not more than five pounds a year.<a id="Anchor_1732" href="#Footnote_1732" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1732.">[1732]</a> In
all these proceedings the chief object evidently was to
procure money for the royal treasury; a tallage which the
judges were also directed to assess upon all cities, towns and
royal demesnes<a id="Anchor_1733" href="#Footnote_1733" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1733.">[1733]</a> being deemed insufficient to supply its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">ii.338</a></span>
needs. The details of this multifarious business are however
of less historical importance than the method employed
for its transaction. Every item of it was to be dealt with
on the presentment of what may now be called the “grand
jury”—the jury of sworn recognitors in every shire, whose
functions, hitherto confined to the presentment of criminals,
were thus extended to all branches of judicial work. This
growth in the importance of the jury was marked by
the introduction of a new ordinance for its constitution.
The Assizes of Clarendon and Northampton simply ordered
that the jury should consist of twelve lawful men of every
hundred and four of every township, without specifying
how they were to be selected. Most probably they were
nominated by the sheriff.<a id="Anchor_1734" href="#Footnote_1734" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1734.">[1734]</a> The recognitors employed in the
civil process known as the Great Assize, however, were from
the first appointed in a special manner prescribed in the
Assize itself. Four knights of the shire were summoned by
the sheriff, and these four elected the twelve recognitors.<a id="Anchor_1735" href="#Footnote_1735" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1735.">[1735]</a>
By the “Form of proceeding in the pleas of the Crown”
delivered to the justices-errant in 1194, this method of election
was applied to the jury of presentment in all cases, with
a modification which removed the choice yet one step further
from the mere nomination of the sheriff. Four knights were
first to be chosen out of the whole shire; these were to elect
two out of every hundred or wapentake, and these two were
to choose ten others, who with them constituted the legal
twelve.<a id="Anchor_1736" href="#Footnote_1736" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1736.">[1736]</a> Whether or not the choice of the first four was
actually, as seems most probable, transferred from the sheriff
to the body of the freeholders assembled in the county-court,<a id="Anchor_1737" href="#Footnote_1737" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1737.">[1737]</a>
still this enactment shews a distinct advance in the principles
of election and representation, as opposed to that of mere
nomination by a royal officer. Another step in the same
direction was the appointment of three knights and a clerk
to be <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">ii.339</a></span>“elected in every shire to keep the pleas of the
Crown.”<a id="Anchor_1738" href="#Footnote_1738" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1738.">[1738]</a> This was the origin of the office afterwards
known as that of coroner. It had the effect of depriving
the sheriff of a considerable part of his judicial functions;
and his importance was at the same time yet further limited
by an order that no sheriff should act as justiciar in his own
shire, nor in any shire which he had held at any time since
the king’s first crowning.<a id="Anchor_1739" href="#Footnote_1739" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1739.">[1739]</a> The difficulty of checking the
abuse of power in the hands of the sheriffs, which Henry
had been unable to overcome, had certainly not been lessened
by Richard’s way of distributing the sheriffdoms in his
earlier years. It had indeed become so serious that in this
very year either the new justiciar, or possibly the king himself,
proposed an inquisition similar to that made by Henry
in 1170, into the administration of all servants of the Crown,
whether justices, sheriffs, constables, or foresters, since the
beginning of the reign. When the king was gone, however,
it seems to have been felt that such an undertaking would
add too heavily to the labours of the judges-errant; and the
inquiry was accordingly postponed for an indefinite time by
the archbishop’s orders.<a id="Anchor_1740" href="#Footnote_1740" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1740.">[1740]</a></p>

<p>The principle of co-operation between the government
and the people for maintaining order and peace, which underlies
all Henry’s reforming measures, and of which the new
regulations for election of the grand jury are a further recognition,
was again enunciated yet more distinctly in the following
year. An edict was published requiring every man above
the age of fifteen years to take an oath that he would do
all that in him lay for the preservation of the king’s peace;
that he would neither be a thief or robber, nor a receiver
or accomplice of such persons, but would do his utmost to
denounce and deliver them to the sheriff, would join to the
uttermost of his power in the pursuit of malefactors when
hue and cry was raised against them, and would deliver up
to the sheriff all persons who should have failed to perform
their share in this duty.<a id="Anchor_1741" href="#Footnote_1741" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1741.">[1741]</a> The obligation binding upon every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">ii.340</a></span>
member of the state to lend his aid for the punishment of
offences against its peace had been declared, in words which
are almost echoed in this edict, as long ago as the reign of
Cnut.<a id="Anchor_1742" href="#Footnote_1742" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1742.">[1742]</a> The difficulty of enforcing it caused by the disorganized
condition of society which had grown up during
the civil war was probably the reason which led Henry, in
framing his Assizes of Clarendon and Northampton, at once
to define it more narrowly and to lay the responsibility of
its execution upon a smaller body of men specially appointed
for the purpose in every shire. The completeness of organization
which the system introduced by these Assizes had
now attained, however, gave scope for a wider application of
the principle through one of those revivals of older custom
in which the enduring character of our ancient national institutions
and their capacity for adaptation to the most diverse
conditions of national life are so often and so strikingly displayed.
The edict of 1195 forms a link between the usage
of Cnut’s day and that of modern times. It directed that
the oath should be taken before knights assigned for the
purpose in every shire; out of the office thus created there
seems to have grown that of conservators of the peace; and
this again developed in the fourteenth century into that of
justices of the peace, which has retained an unbroken existence
down to our own age.<a id="Anchor_1743" href="#Footnote_1743" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1743.">[1743]</a></p>

<p>The same year was marked by the only important
ecclesiastical act of Hubert’s pontificate. Having received
in the spring his commission as legate, he made use of it to
hold a visitation of the northern province—now, by Geoffrey’s
absence and Hugh of Puiset’s death, deprived of both its
chief pastors—and a council in York minster at which
fifteen canons were passed<a id="Anchor_1744" href="#Footnote_1744" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1744.">[1744]</a> to remedy the general relaxation
of Church discipline which had been growing ever since
Thomas’s flight. At the close of the year Hubert was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">ii.341</a></span>
again at York, upon a different errand: the negotiation of
a fresh treaty with Scotland, on the basis of a marriage
between the Scot king’s eldest daughter and Richard’s
nephew Otto of Saxony.<a id="Anchor_1745" href="#Footnote_1745" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1745.">[1745]</a> The marriage never took place,
but the alliance of which it was to be the pledge lasted
throughout Richard’s reign; and it is a noteworthy proof at
once of the growth of friendly relations between the two
countries, and of the success of Hubert’s recent ordinance
for the preservation of peace and order in England, that in
the following year a similar edict, evidently modelled upon
the English one, was issued in Scotland by William the
Lion.<a id="Anchor_1746" href="#Footnote_1746" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1746.">[1746]</a></p>

William the Lion had been sick almost to death, and having no son, had
proposed to leave his crown to his eldest daughter, under the protection of Richard,
whose nephew he wished her to marry. The opposition of his barons, and the
restoration of his own health, caused him to drop the scheme of bequest
    (<cite><abbr title="Roger of">Rog.</abbr>
Howden (Stubbs), <abbr title="volume 3">vol. iii.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 298, 299</cite>).
That of the marriage however was still
pursued, and accepted by Hubert in Richard’s name, on somewhat singular conditions:
Lothian, as the bride’s dowry, was to be given over to Richard’s custody,
while Northumberland and the county of Carlisle were to be settled upon Otto
and made over to the keeping of the king of Scots. The negotiation, however,
dragged on for a year, and was again checked by the hope of an heir to the Scottish
crown
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 308</cite>);
 and the fulfilment of this hope in August 1198 led to its abandonment.

<p>Neither the renewal of order in the Church, nor the
securing of the external tranquillity of the realm by alliance
with its neighbour-states, nor the organization of justice and
police within its own borders, was however the most
laborious part of Hubert’s task. One thing only was
required of him by his royal master; but that was precisely
the one thing which cost him the most trouble to obtain.
From a country which must, as it seems, have been almost
drained of its financial resources over and over again during
the last ten years, he was perpetually called upon to extract
supplies of money such as had never been furnished before
to any English king. That he contrived to meet Richard’s
ceaseless demands year after year without either plunging
the nation into helpless misery or provoking it to open
revolt, is the strongest proof not only of his financial genius
and tact, but also of the increase in material prosperity and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">ii.342</a></span>
national contentment which had been fostered by Henry’s
rule, and of the success of Hubert’s own efforts in carrying
out the policy which Henry had begun. By Michaelmas
1194 it seems that the whole of the complicated accounts
for the ransom, including the carucage imposed in the
spring, were closed.<a id="Anchor_1747" href="#Footnote_1747" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1747.">[1747]</a> In the same year the country had
borne the additional burthen of a tallage upon the towns.
This, however, added to the sums raised by sales of office
during the king’s visit and to the proceeds of the judges’
visitation, failed to satisfy the wants of Richard. He therefore
resorted to two other methods of raising money, both
apparently of his own devising, and both harmonizing very
ill with the constitutional policy of his justiciar. Save during
the disorderly reign of Stephen, the practice of tournaments
had been hitherto unknown in England. Both Henry
<abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> and Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> were too serious and practical-minded to
encourage vain shews of any kind, far less to countenance
the reckless waste of energy and the useless risk of life and
limb which these entertainments involved, which had moved
Pope after Pope to denounce them as perilous alike to body
and soul,<a id="Anchor_1748" href="#Footnote_1748" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1748.">[1748]</a> and, in spite of a characteristic protest from
Thomas Becket, to exclude those who were slain in them from
the privileges of Christian burial.<a id="Anchor_1749" href="#Footnote_1749" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1749.">[1749]</a> The Church had indeed
been unable to check this obnoxious practice in Gaul;
backed, however, by the authority of the Crown, she had
as yet succeeded in keeping it out of England. But in
1194 a fresh prohibition, issued by Pope Celestine in the
previous year,<a id="Anchor_1750" href="#Footnote_1750" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1750.">[1750]</a> was met by Richard with a direct defiance.
On August 20 he issued a license for the holding of tournaments
in England, on condition that every man who took
part in them should pay to the Crown a specified sum,
varying according to his rank. Five places were appointed
where tournaments might be held, and no one was allowed
to enter the lists until he had paid for his license.<a id="Anchor_1751" href="#Footnote_1751" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1751.">[1751]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">ii.343</a></span>
collection of this new item of revenue was evidently looked
upon as an important matter, for it was intrusted to the
justiciar’s brother Theobald Walter.<a id="Anchor_1752" href="#Footnote_1752" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1752.">[1752]</a> Whatever may have
been Hubert’s share in this measure, he was clearly in no
way responsible for the other and yet more desperate
expedient to which Richard, almost at the same time,
resorted for the replenishment of his treasury. On pretext
of a quarrel with his chancellor, he took away the seal from
him, ordered another to be made, and declared all acts
passed under the old one to be null and void, till they should
have been brought to him for confirmation:<a id="Anchor_1753" href="#Footnote_1753" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1753.">[1753]</a> in other words,
till they should have been paid for a second time.</p>

<p>In the following spring a fit of characteristic Angevin
penitence—fervent and absorbing while it lasted, but passing
away all too soon—moved the king to make some amends
for his extortions as well as for his other sins; he began to
replace the church-plate which had been given up for his
ransom;<a id="Anchor_1754" href="#Footnote_1754" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1754.">[1754]</a> no fresh tax was imposed till late in the year, and
then it was only a scutage of the usual amount—twenty
shillings on the knight’s fee—for the war in Normandy.<a id="Anchor_1755" href="#Footnote_1755" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1755.">[1755]</a>
Next year, however, the king’s mood again changed. He
was now resolved to carry into effect, with or without
Hubert’s assent, the inquiry into the financial administration
which Hubert had postponed in 1194. For this purpose he
sent over to England Robert, abbot of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Stephen’s at Caen,
who, notwithstanding his monastic profession, had acquired
great experience as a clerk of the Norman exchequer, and
seems to have there enjoyed a high reputation for knowledge
and skill in all matters of finance.<a id="Anchor_1756" href="#Footnote_1756" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1756.">[1756]</a> The abbot, accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">ii.344</a></span>
by the bishop-elect of Durham, Philip of Poitiers,<a id="Anchor_1757" href="#Footnote_1757" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1757.">[1757]</a> reached
London in Lent 1196, and demanded Hubert’s co-operation
in fulfilling the royal orders. The justiciar, though displeased
and hurt, had no choice but to comply, and an order was
issued in the king’s name bidding all sheriffs and officers of
the Crown be ready to give an account of their stewardship
in London on a certain day—apparently the day of the
usual Exchequer-meeting in Easter-week.<a id="Anchor_1758" href="#Footnote_1758" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1758.">[1758]</a> Before Easter
came, the abbot of Caen himself was gone to his last
account; he was seized with illness while dining with Archbishop
Hubert on Passion Sunday, and five days later he
died.<a id="Anchor_1759" href="#Footnote_1759" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1759.">[1759]</a> The intended inquisition never took place; but the
mere proposal to conduct it thus through the medium of a
stranger from over sea was a direct slight offered to the
justiciar by the king;<a id="Anchor_1760" href="#Footnote_1760" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1760.">[1760]</a> and it coincided with a disturbance
which warned Hubert of a possible danger to his authority
from another quarter.</p>

<p>Strive as he might to equalize the burthens of taxation,
he could not prevent them from pressing upon the poorer
classes with a severity which grew at last well-nigh intolerable.
The grievance was felt most keenly in London. The
substitution of the “commune” for the older shire-organization
of London in 1191 was a step towards municipal unity,
and thus indirectly towards local independence and self-government;
but it had done nothing for the poorer class of
citizens. It had placed the entire control of civic administration,
including the regulation of trade and the assessment
of taxes, in the hands of a governing body consisting of a
mayor and aldermen, one of whom presided over each of the
wards into which the whole city was divided, the head of
them all being the mayor.<a id="Anchor_1761" href="#Footnote_1761" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1761.">[1761]</a> This corporation was the representative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">ii.345</a></span>
of the merchant-gild, which had thus absorbed into
itself all the powers and privileges of the earlier ruling class
of territorial magnates, in addition to its own. As might be
expected, the rule of this newly-established oligarchy over
the mass of its unenfranchized fellow-citizens was at least as
oppressive as that of the sheriffs and “barons of the city”
which had preceded it; and it was less willingly borne,
owing to the jealousy which always existed between the
craftsmen and the merchant-gild. As the taxes grew more
burthensome year by year, a suspicion began to spread that
they were purposely assessed in such a manner as to spare
the well-filled pockets of the assessors, and wring an unfair
proportion of the required total from the hard-earned savings
of the poor.<a id="Anchor_1762" href="#Footnote_1762" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1762.">[1762]</a> Whether the injustice was intentional or not,
the grievance seems to have been a real one; and it soon
found a spokesman and a champion. William Fitz-Osbert—“William
with the Long Beard,” as he was commonly
called—was by birth a member of the ruling class in the
city.<a id="Anchor_1763" href="#Footnote_1763" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1763.">[1763]</a> He seems to have shared with a goldsmith named
Geoffrey the leadership of a band of London citizens who
in 1190 formed part of the crusading fleet, and did good
service, not indeed, so far as we know, in Holy Land, but
like their brethren forty-three years earlier, in helping to
drive the Moors out of Portugal.<a id="Anchor_1764" href="#Footnote_1764" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1764.">[1764]</a> Since his return, whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">ii.346</a></span>
fired by genuine zeal for the cause of the oppressed, or, as
some of his contemporaries thought, moved by the hope of
acquiring power and influence which he found unattainable
by other means,<a id="Anchor_1765" href="#Footnote_1765" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1765.">[1765]</a> he had severed himself from his natural
associates in the city to become the preacher and leader of
another sort of crusade, for the deliverance of the poorer
classes from the tyranny of their wealthy rulers. At every
meeting of the governing body he withstood his fellow-aldermen
to the face, remonstrating continually against their
corrupt fiscal administration. They could not silence and
dared not expel him, for they knew that his whispers were
stirring up the craftsmen; and although the rumour that he
had more than fifty thousand sworn followers at his back
must have been an exaggeration, yet there could be no
doubt of the existence of a conspiracy sufficiently formidable
to excuse, if not to justify, the terror of the civic rulers.<a id="Anchor_1766" href="#Footnote_1766" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1766.">[1766]</a>
When after a visit to Normandy William began openly to
boast of the king’s favour and support, the justiciar thought
it time to interfere. He called the citizens together, endeavoured
to allay their discontent by reasonings and
remonstrances, and persuaded them to give hostages for
their good behaviour.<a id="Anchor_1767" href="#Footnote_1767" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1767.">[1767]</a> William however set his authority
at defiance. Day after day, in the streets and open spaces
of the city, and at last even in <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Paul’s itself,<a id="Anchor_1768" href="#Footnote_1768" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1768.">[1768]</a> this bold
preacher with the tall stately form, singular aspect and
eloquent tongue gathered round him a crowd of eager
listeners to whom he proclaimed himself as the “king and
saviour of the poor.” One of his audience afterwards
reported to a writer of the time his exposition of a text
from Isaiah: “With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells
of the Saviour.”<a id="Anchor_1769" href="#Footnote_1769" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1769.">[1769]</a> “I,” said William, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">ii.347</a></span>“am the saviour of
the poor. Ye poor who have felt the heavy hand of the
rich, ye shall draw from my wells the water of wholesome
doctrine, and that with joy, for the time of your visitation
is at hand. For I will divide the waters from the waters.
The people are the waters; and I will divide the humble and
faithful people from the proud and perfidious people. I will
divide the elect from the reprobate, as light from darkness.”<a id="Anchor_1770" href="#Footnote_1770" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1770.">[1770]</a></p>

<p>Powerless to deal with these assemblies within the city,
Hubert determined at least to check the spread of such
teaching as this, and issued orders that any citizen of the
lower class found outside the walls should be arrested as
an enemy to king and kingdom. Some chapmen from
London were accordingly arrested at Mid-Lent at Stamford
fair.<a id="Anchor_1771" href="#Footnote_1771" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1771.">[1771]</a> A day or two afterwards—the justiciar’s fears being
perhaps quickened by the arrival of the abbot of Caen,
which William might easily interpret as the effect of his
own remonstrances with the king—an attempt was made to
call William himself to account for his seditious proceedings.
The bearer of the summons found him surrounded by such
a formidable array of followers that he dared not execute
his commission, and a forcible arrest was decided on.
Guided by two citizens who undertook to catch him at
unawares, a party of armed men was sent to seize him;<a id="Anchor_1772" href="#Footnote_1772" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1772.">[1772]</a>
one of the guides was felled with a blow of a hatchet by
William himself, the other was slain by his friends; William,
with a few adherents, took sanctuary in the church of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Mary-at-Bow. The justiciar, after surrounding the church
with soldiers, ordered it to be set on fire,<a id="Anchor_1773" href="#Footnote_1773" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1773.">[1773]</a> and William,
driven out by the smoke and the flames, was stabbed on the
threshold by the son of the man whom he had killed an
hour before.<a id="Anchor_1774" href="#Footnote_1774" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1774.">[1774]</a> The wound however was not immediately
fatal; the soldiers seized him and carried him to the Tower
for trial before the justiciars, who at once condemned him
to death; he was stripped, tied to a horse’s tail, thus
dragged through the city, and hanged with eight of his
adherents.<a id="Anchor_1775" href="#Footnote_1775" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1775.">[1775]</a> The rest of the malcontents were so overawed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">ii.348</a></span>
by this spectacle that they at once made complete submission.<a id="Anchor_1776" href="#Footnote_1776" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1776.">[1776]</a>
The justiciar had triumphed; but his triumph was
dearly bought at the cost of what little still remained to
him of personal popularity and ecclesiastical repute. The
common people persisted in reverencing William Longbeard
as a martyr;<a id="Anchor_1777" href="#Footnote_1777" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1777.">[1777]</a> the clergy were horrified at the sacrilege
involved in the violation of the right of sanctuary and the
firing of a church, a sacrilege all the more unpardonable
because committed by an archbishop; while his own chapter
seized upon it as the crowning charge in the already long
indictment which they were preparing against their primate.<a id="Anchor_1778" href="#Footnote_1778" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1778.">[1778]</a>
Thus overwhelmed with obloquy on all sides, Hubert in
disgust for a moment threw up the justiciarship, but resumed
it as soon as he was once more assured of Richard’s
confidence.<a id="Anchor_1779" href="#Footnote_1779" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1779.">[1779]</a> For two more years he toiled on at his thankless
task. The budget of 1196 was made up by the safe
expedient of another scutage.<a id="Anchor_1780" href="#Footnote_1780" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1780.">[1780]</a> Next year the sole legislative
act ventured upon by the justiciar was an attempt to
enforce uniformity of weights and measures throughout the
kingdom by means of an Assize,<a id="Anchor_1781" href="#Footnote_1781" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1781.">[1781]</a> whose provisions however
turned out to be so impracticable that, like a similar ordinance
issued earlier in the reign, it seems to have remained
inoperative, and six years later was abolished altogether.<a id="Anchor_1782" href="#Footnote_1782" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1782.">[1782]</a>
In the autumn Hubert went over to Normandy, where he
was occupied for some weeks in diplomatic business for the
king.<a id="Anchor_1783" href="#Footnote_1783" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1783.">[1783]</a> A month after his return the crisis came.</p>

<p>Richard, at the height of his struggle with Philip of
France, found himself short not only of money but of men,<a id="Anchor_1784" href="#Footnote_1784" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1784.">[1784]</a>
at any rate of men whom he could trust. He called upon
Hubert to send him over from England either a force of
three hundred knights to serve him at their own charges for
a year, or a sum which would enable him to enlist the same
number of mercenaries for the same period, at the rate of
three English shillings a day.<a id="Anchor_1785" href="#Footnote_1785" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1785.">[1785]</a> For some reason or other it
seems that Hubert, somewhat unwisely, at once decided to
ignore the second alternative; in a great council held at
Oxford on December 7<a id="Anchor_1786" href="#Footnote_1786" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1786.">[1786]</a> he simply proposed, in his own
name and that of his colleagues in the government, that the
barons of England, among whom the bishops were to be
reckoned, should come to the rescue of their distressed
sovereign by supplying him with three hundred knights to
serve him at their own cost for a year. Hubert himself, in
his character of archbishop, declared his readiness to take
his share of the burthen; so did the bishop of London,
Richard Fitz-Nigel the treasurer. The bishop of Lincoln,
Hugh of Avalon, was then asked for his assent. “O ye
wise and noble men here present,” said the Burgundian
saint, “ye know that I came to this land as a stranger, and
from the simplicity of a hermit’s life was raised to the office
of a bishop. When therefore my inexperience was called to
rule over the church of our Lady, I set myself carefully to
learn its customs and privileges, its duties and burthens; and
for thirteen years I have not strayed from the path marked
out by my predecessors, in preserving the one and fulfilling
the other. I know that the church of Lincoln is bound to do
the king military service, but only in this land; outside the
boundaries of England she owes him no such thing. Wherefore
I deem it meeter for me to go back to my native land
and my hermit’s cell, rather than, while holding a bishopric
here, to bring upon my church the loss of her ancient
immunities and the infliction of unwonted burthens.”<a id="Anchor_1787" href="#Footnote_1787" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1787.">[1787]</a></p>

<p>Hugh of Lincoln was the universally-acknowledged
leader of the English Church in all matters of religion and
morals; he had exercised in Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>’s later years such an
influence over the king as no one, except perhaps Thomas
Becket, had ever possessed; the whole Church and nation
reverenced him as it had never reverenced any man since
the death of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Anselm. When he took up the position of
Thomas and Anselm as a champion of constitutional liberty,
the victory was sure. Strangely enough, his action seems
to have taken the primate completely by surprise. For a
moment Hubert stood speechless; then he turned to Bishop
Herbert of Salisbury, and with quivering lips asked what he
was minded to do for the king’s assistance. As a son of
Richard of Ilchester and a kinsman of the great ministerial
house founded by Roger of Salisbury,<a id="Anchor_1788" href="#Footnote_1788" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1788.">[1788]</a> Herbert represented
the traditions of an old and venerated political school, as
Hugh represented those of the best school of ecclesiastics.
The statesman’s reply was an echo of the saint’s: “It seems
to me that, without grievous wrong to my church, I can
neither do nor say aught but what I have heard from my
lord of Lincoln.” The justiciar, hurling a torrent of
reproaches at Hugh, broke up the assembly, and wrote
to the king that his plan had been foiled through Hugh’s
opposition.<a id="Anchor_1789" href="#Footnote_1789" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1789.">[1789]</a> Richard in a fury ordered the property of the
two recalcitrant bishops to be confiscated; in the case of
Salisbury this was done, but no Englishman dared lay
a finger on anything belonging to the saint of Lincoln, “for
they feared his curse like death itself.” In vain did the
king reiterate his command, till at last his own officers
begged Hugh to put an end to the scandal by making
his peace, for their sakes if not for his own; Hugh therefore
went to seek Richard in Normandy, and literally forced him
into a reconciliation on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Augustine’s day. Herbert, on the
other hand, had to purchase his restoration at a heavy price;<a id="Anchor_1790" href="#Footnote_1790" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1790.">[1790]</a>
but the king and his justiciar were none the less completely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">ii.351</a></span>
beaten. The death of Rees Ap-Griffith and a dispute
between his sons for the succession in South Wales gave
Hubert an opportunity of renewing his fading laurels by a
brilliant expedition to the Welsh marches, where he succeeded
in restoring tranquillity and securing the border-fortresses
for the king.<a id="Anchor_1791" href="#Footnote_1791" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1791.">[1791]</a> He had however scarcely had time
to recover from his political defeat before he was overwhelmed
by the bursting of an ecclesiastical storm which had long
been hanging over his head. Pope Celestine died on
January 8, 1198. On the morrow the cardinals elected as
his successor a young deacon named Lothar, who took the
name of Innocent <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>, and began at once to sweep away the
abuses of the Roman court and to vindicate the rights of his
see against the Roman aristocracy with a promptness and
vigour which were an earnest of his whole future career.<a id="Anchor_1792" href="#Footnote_1792" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1792.">[1792]</a>
The monks of Canterbury lost no time in sending to the new
Pope their list of grievances against their primate; and at
the head of the list they set a charge which, in the eyes of
such a pontiff as Innocent, could admit of no defence.
Hubert, said they, had violated the duties and the dignity
of his order by becoming the king’s justiciar, acting as
a judge in cases of life and death, and so entangling himself
in worldly business that he was incapable of paying due
attention to the government of the Church. Innocent
immediately wrote to the king, charging him, if he valued
his soul’s health, not to suffer either the archbishop of
Canterbury or any other priest to continue in any secular
office; and at the same time he solemnly forbade the acceptance
of any such office by any bishop or priest throughout
the whole Church. Discredited as Hubert now was in the
eyes of all parties, he had no choice but to resign, and this
time Richard had no choice but to accept his resignation.<a id="Anchor_1793" href="#Footnote_1793" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1793.">[1793]</a></p>

<p>The last few months of his justiciarship were however
occupied with the projection, if not the execution, of a
measure of great constitutional importance. Early in the
spring he had, in his master’s name, laid upon England a
carucage to the amount of five shillings upon every carucate
or ploughland. The great increase in the rate of taxation,
as compared with that of 1194, was not unjustifiable; for
since that year the socage-tenants, on whom the impost
fell, had paid no direct taxes at all, while two scutages had
been exacted from the tenants-in-chivalry. But a far more
important change was made in the assessment of the new
impost. Until now, the carucate, like the hide, had been a
term of elastic significance. It represented, as the literal
meaning of the word implied, the extent of land which could
be cultivated by a single plough; and this of course varied
in different parts of the country according to the nature of
the soil, and the number and strength of the plough-team.
In general, however, a hundred acres seem to have been
reckoned as the average extent both of the carucate and of
the hide. In order to avoid the endless complications and
disputes which under the old system had made the assessment
of the land-tax a matter of almost more trouble than
profit, Hubert Walter adopted this average as a fixed
standard, and ordered that henceforth, for purposes of taxation,
the word “carucate” should represent a hundred
acres. It followed as a necessary consequence that the
whole arable land of England must be re-measured. The
old customary reckoning of hides, based upon the Domesday
survey, would no longer answer its purpose: the venerable
rate-book which had been in use for more than a hundred
years, partially superseded since 1168 by the Black Book
of the Exchequer, was now to be superseded entirely.
Hubert therefore issued in the king’s name a commission
for what was virtually a new Domesday survey. Into every
shire he sent a clerk and a knight, who, together with the
sheriff and certain lawful men chosen out of the shire, were,
after swearing that they would do the king’s business faithfully,
to summon before them the stewards of the barons of
the county, the lord or bailiff of every township and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">ii.353</a></span>
reeve and four lawful men of the same, whether free or
villein, and two lawful knights of the hundred; these persons
were to declare upon oath what ploughlands there were
in every township—how many in demesne, how many in
villenage, how many in alms, and who was responsible for
these last. The carucates thus ascertained were noted in a
roll of which four copies were kept, one by each of the two
royal commissioners, one by the sheriff, and the other divided
among the stewards of the local barons. The collection of
the money was intrusted to two lawful knights and the bailiff
of every hundred; these were responsible for it to the sheriff;
and the sheriff had to see that it agreed with his roll, and to
pay it into the Exchequer. Stern penalties were denounced
against witnesses, whether free or villein, who should be
detected in trying to deceive the commissioners. No land
was to be exempted from the tax, except the free estates
belonging to the parish churches, and lands held of the king
by serjeanty or special service; even these last, however,
were to be included in the survey, and their holders were
required to come and prove their excuses at its conclusion,
in London at the octave of Pentecost.<a id="Anchor_1794" href="#Footnote_1794" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1794.">[1794]</a></p>

<p>This was Hubert’s last great administrative act, and it
had a far more important significance than he himself probably
knew. In form, the application of the process of jury-inquest
to the assessment of an impost on the land was only
a return to the precedent of Domesday itself. In reality,
however, it was something much more important than this.
The jury-inquest had been introduced by the Conqueror in
1086 under exceptional circumstances, and for an exceptional
purpose which could be attained by no other means.
So far as its original use was concerned, the precedent had
remained a wholly isolated one for more than a hundred
years. But during those years the principle which lay at
the root of the jury-inquest had made its way into every
branch of legal, fiscal and judicial administration. It had
been applied to the purposes of private litigation by the
Great Assize, to the determination of individual liability to
military duty by the Assize of Arms, to the assessment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">ii.354</a></span>
of taxation on personal property by the ordinance of the
Saladin tithe; it had penetrated the whole system of
criminal procedure through the Assizes of Clarendon and
Northampton; and it had gained a yet fuller recognition in
the judicial ordinances of 1194. Viewed in this light, its
application to the assessment of taxation on real property
was another highly important step in the extension of its
sphere of work. But this was not all. The chief value of
the jury-system lay in its employment of the machinery of
local representation and election, whereby it was a means of
training the people to the exercise of constitutional self-government.
The commission of 1198 shews that, although
doubtless neither rulers nor people were conscious of the
fact, this training had now advanced within measurable
distance of its completion. The machinery of the new
survey was not identical with that used in 1086. The
taxpayers were represented, not only by the witnesses on
whose recognition the assessment was based, but by the
“lawful men chosen out of the shire” who took their place
side by side with the king’s officers as commissioners for the
assessment, and by the bailiff and two knights of the hundred
who were charged with the collection of the money. The
representative principle had now reached its furthest developement
in the financial administration of the shire. Its next
advance must inevitably result in giving to the taxpayers a
share in the determination, first of the amount of the impost,
and then of the purposes to which it should be applied, by
admitting them, however partially and indirectly, to a voice in
the great council of the nation.<a id="Anchor_1795" href="#Footnote_1795" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1795.">[1795]</a></p>

<p>We must not credit Hubert Walter with views so lofty
or so far-reaching as these. The chief aim of his policy
doubtless was to get for his master as much money as he
could, although he would only do it by what he regarded
as just and constitutional methods. Unluckily the commissioners’
report is lost, and there is not even any proof that
it was ever presented; for before Whitsuntide the new Pope’s
views had become known, and on July 11 a royal writ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">ii.355</a></span>
announced Hubert’s retirement from the justiciarship and
the appointment of Geoffrey Fitz-Peter in his stead.<a id="Anchor_1796" href="#Footnote_1796" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1796.">[1796]</a> Like
Hubert, Geoffrey Fitz-Peter came of a family which had
long been engaged in administrative work. His elder
brother Simon had in Henry’s early years filled the various
offices of sheriff, justice-in-eyre, and king’s marshal.<a id="Anchor_1797" href="#Footnote_1797" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1797.">[1797]</a> Geoffrey
himself had been sheriff of Northampton throughout the last
five years of Henry’s reign, and had during the same period
acted occasionally as an ordinary justice of assize, and more
frequently as a judge of the forest-court.<a id="Anchor_1798" href="#Footnote_1798" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1798.">[1798]</a> In 1189 Richard
appointed him one of the assistant-justiciars, and in this
capacity he supported Walter of Rouen in the affair of
William of Longchamp’s deposition.<a id="Anchor_1799" href="#Footnote_1799" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1799.">[1799]</a> In the early days of
William’s rule, however, Geoffrey had made use of the latter’s
influence to secure for himself the whole English inheritance
of the earl of Essex, William de Mandeville, upon which his
wife had a distant claim.<a id="Anchor_1800" href="#Footnote_1800" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1800.">[1800]</a> Such a man was likely to be
controlled by fewer scruples, as well as hampered by fewer
external restraints, than those which had beset the justiciar-archbishop;
and in truth, before the year was out,
both clergy and people had cause to regret the change of
ministers. Some of the religious orders refused to pay their
share of the carucage; their refusal was met by a royal edict
declaring the whole body of clergy, secular as well as monastic,
incapable of claiming redress for any wrongs inflicted
on them by the laity, while for any injury done by a clerk
or a monk to a layman satisfaction was exacted to the
uttermost farthing. The archbishop of Canterbury could
hardly have published what was virtually a decree of outlawry
against his own order; the new justiciar published it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">ii.356</a></span>
seemingly without hesitation, and the recalcitrant monks
were compelled to submit.<a id="Anchor_1801" href="#Footnote_1801" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1801.">[1801]</a> This act was followed by a
renewal of the decree requiring all charters granted under
the king’s old seal to be brought up for confirmation under
the new one<a id="Anchor_1802" href="#Footnote_1802" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1802.">[1802]</a>—a step which seems to imply that Richard’s
former command to this effect had not been very strictly
enforced by Hubert. Meanwhile three justices-errant, acting
on a set of instructions modelled upon those of 1194, were
holding pleas of the Crown in the northern shires;<a id="Anchor_1803" href="#Footnote_1803" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1803.">[1803]</a> “so that,”
says King Henry’s old chaplain Roger of Howden, “with
these and other vexations, just or unjust, all England from
sea to sea was reduced to penury. And these things were
not yet ended when another kind of torment was added to
confound the men of the kingdom, through the justices of
the forest,” who were sent out all over England to hold a
great forest-assize, which was virtually a renewal of that
issued by Henry in 1184.<a id="Anchor_1804" href="#Footnote_1804" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1804.">[1804]</a></p>

<p>Stern and cruel, however, as was the administration of
the last eight months of Richard’s reign, it was still part of
a salutary discipline. The milder chastenings which Richard’s
English subjects had endured from Hubert Walter, the
scorpion-lashes with which he chastised them by the hands
of Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, were both alike stages in the training
which Richard’s predecessor had begun, and whose value
they were to learn when left face to face with the personal
tyranny of his successor. For nearer at hand than they
could dream was the day when English people and Angevin
king were to stand face to face indeed, more closely than
they had ever stood before. The nine generations of increasing
prosperity promised to Fulk the Good were all
numbered and fulfilled, and with their fulfilment had come
the turn of the tide. The power of the Angevins had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">ii.357</a></span>
reached its destined limit, and had begun to recede again.
From the sacred eastern land all trace of it was already
swept away; in the west it was, slowly indeed as yet, but
none the less surely falling back. Five years were still to
pass before the tide should be fairly out; then it was to
leave the Good Count’s heir stranded, not on the black rock
of Angers, but on the white cliffs of England.</p>

<p>Richard had spent the first half of his reign in fighting
for a lost cause in Palestine; he spent the other half in
fighting for a losing cause in Gaul. The final result of the
long series of conquests and annexations whereby the Angevin
counts, from Fulk the Red to Henry Fitz-Empress,
had been enlarging their borders for more than two hundred
years, had been to bring them into direct geographical contact
and political antagonism with an enemy more formidable
than any whom they had yet encountered. In their
earliest days the king of the French had been their patron;
a little later, he had become their tool. Now, he was their
sole remaining rival; and ere long he was to be their conqueror.
Since the opening of the century, a great change
had taken place in the political position of the French
Crown; a change which was in a considerable measure
due to the yet greater change in the position of the Angevin
house. When Louis <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> came to the throne in 1109, he
found the so-called “kingdom of France” distributed somewhat
as follows. The western half, from the river Somme
to the Pyrenees, was divided between four great fiefs—Normandy,
Britanny, Anjou and Aquitaine. Four others—Champagne,
Burgundy, Auvergne and Toulouse—covered
its eastern portion from the river Meuse to the Mediterranean
Sea; another, Flanders, occupied its northernmost angle,
between the sources of the Meuse, the mouth of the Scheld,
and the English Channel. The two lines of great fiefs were
separated by an irregular group of smaller territories, amid
which lay, distributed in two very unequal portions, the royal
domain. Its northern and larger half, severed from Flanders
by the little counties of Amiens and Vermandois, was flanked
on the east by Champagne and on the north-west by Normandy,
while its south-western border was ringed in by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">ii.358</a></span>
counties of Chartres, Blois and Sancerre, which parted it
from Anjou, and which were all linked together with Champagne
under the same ruling house. Southward, in the
upper valleys of the Loire and the Cher, a much smaller
fragment of royal domain, comprising the viscounty of
Bourges and the territory afterwards known as the Bourbonnais,
lay crowded in between Auvergne, the Aquitanian
district of Berry, and the Burgundian counties of Mâcon and
Nevers and that of Sancerre, which parted it from the larger
royal possessions north of the Loire. The whole domains
of the Crown thus covered scarcely more ground than the
united counties of Anjou, Touraine and Maine, scarcely so
much as the duchy of Normandy. Within these limits,
however, Louis <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> had in his twenty-nine years’ reign contrived
to establish his absolute authority on so firm a basis
that from thenceforth the independence of the Crown was
secured. To destroy that of the great feudataries, and to
bring them one by one into a subjection as absolute as that
of the royal domain itself, was the work which he bequeathed
to his successors.</p>

</div>

<p>We may set aside the temporary annexation of Aquitaine
through the marriage of Louis <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr> and Eleanor as
forming no part of this process of absorption. In the plans
of Louis <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> it was doubtless meant to be a very important
part; but as a matter of fact, its historical importance proved
to be of a wholly different kind. The marriage of Louis
and Eleanor contributed to the final acquisition of Guienne
and Gascony by the French Crown not a whit more than
the marriage of Geoffrey Martel and Agnes had contributed
to their acquisition by the house of Anjou. The Parisian
king, like his Angevin follower of old, had work to do on
his own side of the Loire before he might safely attempt the
conquest of the south. By the middle of the century, the
map of Gaul had undergone a marked transformation. Its
eastern and central portions indeed remained unchanged;
but the western half was utterly metamorphosed. Its four
great divisions had been virtually swept away, and the whole
land had become Angevin. In face of this altered state of
things, the remaining powers of northern Gaul were of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">ii.359</a></span>
necessity driven into union, as a counterpoise to this
enormous growth of Anjou; and the only possible centre of
union, alike in a political and a geographical point of view, was
the king of the French. He alone could claim to match in
rank and dignity the crowned masters of the west; and
under his leadership alone was it possible to face them all
along the line from the mouth of the Somme to the source
of the Cher with a front as unbroken as their own. The
old Angevin march had ceased to be a marchland at all; its
original character was now transferred to the counties of
Chartres and Blois; while to north and south of these, from
Nonancourt to Aumale and along the whole course of the
Cher above Vierzon, the royal domain itself was the sole
bulwark of north-eastern Gaul against the advancing power
of Anjou. To secure Chartres and Blois was the first
necessity for the king: but their counts needed his protection
even more than he needed their fidelity, for the
whole width of his domains parted them from Champagne,
where the bulk of their strength lay. Accordingly Louis <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr>,
by the matrimonial alliances which he formed first for his
daughters and lastly for himself with the house of Blois and
Champagne, easily succeeded in binding them to a community
of personal interests with the royal house of France,
whereby their subservience to the French Crown was for the
future secured. The chain was too strong to be broken by
the boyish wilfulness of Philip Augustus; and from the
moment of his reconciliation with his mother and uncles
in 1180, the whole military and political strength of
Blois, Chartres and Champagne may be reckoned at his
command as unreservedly as that of his own immediate
domains.</p>

<p>Since that time, the royal power had made an important
advance to the northward. At the opening of Philip’s reign
the dominions of the count of Flanders stretched from the
Channel to the borders of Champagne, covered the whole
northern frontier of the royal domain, and touched that of
Normandy at its junction with Ponthieu. Twelve years
later, more than half this territory had passed, either by
cession or by conquest, into the hands of the king. Vermandois<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">ii.360</a></span>
was given up to him in 1186; and in 1191 the
death of the Flemish count Philip made him master of all
Flanders south of the river Lys, which had been promised to
him as the dowry of his first queen, Elizabeth of Hainaut,
niece of the dead count and daughter of his successor.<a id="Anchor_1805" href="#Footnote_1805" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1805.">[1805]</a>
This was in several respects a most valuable acquisition.
Not only did it bring to the Crown a considerable accession
of territory, including the whole upper valley of the Somme,
the famous fortress of Péronne, and the flourishing towns of
Amiens and Arras; but the power of Flanders, which a few
years before had threatened to overshadow every other power
in northern Gaul, was completely broken; and the effect
upon the political position of Normandy was more important
still. While Vermandois and Amiens were in Flemish
hands, a league between the Flemish count and the ruler
of Normandy would at any moment not only place the
whole north-western border of France at their mercy, but
would enable them to call in the forces of the imperial
Crown to a junction which the French king could have no
power to hinder, and which must almost certainly lead to
his ruin. Now, on the other hand, such a junction was
rendered well-nigh impossible; the whole territory between
Normandy, Ponthieu and the German border was in the
king’s own hands, and all that was left of Flanders lay in
almost complete isolation between the Lys and the sea. In
fine, as the dukes of Burgundy had for several generations
been obedient followers of their royal kinsmen, now that
Blois, Champagne and Vermandois were all secured, the
power and influence of the French Crown north of the
Loire was fully a match in territorial extent for that of the
house of Anjou. South of the Loire the balance was less
equal. The extensive possessions of the house of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Gilles
may indeed be left out of both scales; their homage for
Toulouse was now secured to the dukes of Aquitaine, but it
was a mere formality which left them practically still independent
of both their rival overlords. It was indeed at the
expense of Toulouse that the Angevin rulers of Poitou had
made their last conquest, that of the Quercy. But since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">ii.361</a></span>
then the French king, too, had been gaining territory in
Aquitaine; and his gains were made at the expense of the
Poitevin duke. Richard had found it needful to buy Philip’s
assent to his peaceful entrance upon his ancestral heritage
after his father’s death by a renunciation of all claims upon
Auvergne and a cession of two important lordships in Berry,
Graçay and Issoudun.<a id="Anchor_1806" href="#Footnote_1806" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1806.">[1806]</a> The sacrifice was trifling in itself,
but it was significant. It marked Richard’s own consciousness
that a turning-point had come in the career of his
house. Hitherto they had gone steadily forward; now it
was time to draw back. The aggressive attitude which had
been habitual to the counts of Anjou for nearly three hundred
years must be dropped at last. Henceforth they were to
stand on the defensive in their turn against the advance of
the French Crown.</p>

<p>It was not the strength of that advance itself which made
it so formidable to Richard; it was the knowledge that, side
by side with the process of consolidation in France, there
had been and still was going on in the Angevin dominions
a process of disintegration which his father had been unable
to check, and against which he himself was well-nigh helpless.
The French monarchy was built up around one definite
centre, a centre round which all the subordinate parts of the
structure grouped themselves unquestioningly as a matter of
course. Paris and its king, even when his practical authority
was at the lowest ebb, had always been in theory the accepted
rallying-point of the whole kingdom, the acknowledged head
of the body politic, none of whose members had ever dreamed
of establishing any other in its place. But the empire of
Richard Cœur-de-Lion had no centre; or rather, it had
three or four rival ones. In Angevin eyes its centre was
Angers; in Norman eyes it was Rouen; to the men of the
south, it was Poitiers. Even Henry Fitz-Empress had felt
at times the difficulty of fulfilling two such opposite parts as
those of duke of Normandy and count of Anjou without
rousing the jealous resentment of either country against
himself as the representative of the other; while as for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">ii.362</a></span>
Britanny and Aquitaine, he had only been able to keep an
uncertain hold over them by sheer force, until Britanny was
appeased by the marriage of Constance, and Aquitaine subdued
by the vigour of Richard. But for Richard in his
father’s place the difficulty was far greater. Chafe as they
might against the yoke which bound them together—dispute
as they might over their respective shares in their common
ruler and their respective claims upon him—neither Angevin
nor Norman could fail to recognize his own natural sovereign
and national representative in the son of Geoffrey and
Matilda. But the chances of this recognition being extended
to the next generation expired with the young king. If the
two Henrys were strangers in Britanny and in Aquitaine,
yet on the banks of the Seine, the Loire and the Mayenne
they were felt to be at home. But Richard was at home
nowhere, though he was master everywhere, from the Solway
to the Pyrenees. His Aquitanian subjects for the most part,
if they counted him as a fellow-countryman, counted him
none the less as an enemy; his subjects north of Loire
counted him as a southern stranger. Normans and Angevins
still saw in him, as they had been taught to see in him for
the first twenty-six years of his life, the representative not
of Hrolf and William or of Fulk the Red and Geoffrey
Martel, but simply of his mother’s Poitevin ancestors. The
Bretons saw in him the son of their conqueror, asserting his
supremacy over them and their young native prince only
by the right of the stronger. As Suger had laid it down
as an axiom, more than half a century ago, that “Englishmen
ought not to rule over Frenchmen nor French over
English,” so now we begin to discern growing up in
Richard’s continental dominions a feeling that Normans
should not rule over Angevins, nor Angevins over Normans,
nor either over Bretons and Poitevins, nor Poitevins
over any of the rest; and that if one and all must
needs submit to the loss of their ancient independence,
it would be more natural and less humiliating to lay it
down at the feet of the prince who had always been acknowledged
in theory as the superior of all alike, the king of the
French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">ii.363</a></span></p>

<p>This feeling, however, had scarcely come into existence,
much less risen to the surface of politics, when Philip
Augustus came home from the Crusade at Christmas 1191.
It is scarcely probable that any plan of actual conquest had
as yet taken shape in Philip’s mind. But the very audacity
of the demand which he made upon the credulity of the
Norman constables when in the following spring he asked
them to believe that Richard had ceded to him not only the
whole Vexin, but also the counties of Aumale and Eu—a
cession for which there was not a shadow of reason either in
past history or in present circumstances, and which if carried
into effect would have cut off the Norman communications
with Ponthieu and Flanders, and given him at once a
foothold upon the Channel and an invaluable coign of vantage
for an attempt upon Rouen—seems to indicate that he
was already forming some more definite design against the
Angevins’ power than the simple system of lying in wait to
steal from them any territorial or political advantage that
could be stolen with impunity, with which he, like his father,
had hitherto been content. The terms of his treaty with
John in the following year point still more strongly in the
same direction. As the price of John’s investiture with the
rest of his brother’s dominions, Philip reserved to himself
the whole Norman territory on the right bank of the Seine,
except the city of Rouen; on the left bank, nearly half the
viscounty of Evreux, including the castles of Vaudreuil,
Verneuil and Ivry; and from the older Angevin patrimony,
all that was most worth having in Touraine—Tours itself,
Azay, Montbazon, Montrichard, Amboise and Loches—besides
the transfer of the Angevin fiefs in the Vendômois
from the count of Anjou to the count of Blois.<a id="Anchor_1807" href="#Footnote_1807" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1807.">[1807]</a> Owing to
the disorganized state of Richard’s dominions caused by his
captivity, Philip’s endeavours to carry this bargain into effect
by conquering Normandy in John’s interest and his own
met for a while with considerable success. His first attempt
at invasion was indeed repulsed by the Norman barons under
the leadership of Earl Robert of Leicester;<a id="Anchor_1808" href="#Footnote_1808" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1808.">[1808]</a> but a few weeks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">ii.364</a></span>
later treason opened to him the gates of Gisors and Neaufle;
the rest of the Vexin was easily won,<a id="Anchor_1809" href="#Footnote_1809" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1809.">[1809]</a> and secured thus
against attack in his rear, he marched northward to the
capture of Aumale and Eu.<a id="Anchor_1810" href="#Footnote_1810" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1810.">[1810]</a> Thence he turned back to
besiege Rouen, but soon retreated again into his own territories,<a id="Anchor_1811" href="#Footnote_1811" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1811.">[1811]</a>
taking Pacy and Ivry on his way.<a id="Anchor_1812" href="#Footnote_1812" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1812.">[1812]</a> In July, finding
that, according to his own phrase, the Angevin demon was
after all to be let loose upon him once more, he thought it
advisable to accept Richard’s overtures of peace; and Richard
on his part—being still in prison—deemed it wise for the
moment to sanction the French king’s recent conquests in
Normandy and the liberation of Ademar of Angoulême, and
also to let Philip have temporary possession of Loches,
Châtillon-sur-Indre, Driencourt and Arques, as pledges for
the payment of twenty thousand marks, due within two
years of his own release.<a id="Anchor_1813" href="#Footnote_1813" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1813.">[1813]</a></p>

<p>Whether he intended to keep or to break these engagements
is practically no matter; for, if he meant to break
them, Philip took care to anticipate him. Seven months
after the treaty was signed he again crossed the Norman
border, took Evreux,<a id="Anchor_1814" href="#Footnote_1814" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1814.">[1814]</a> which he handed over to John’s custody,<a id="Anchor_1815" href="#Footnote_1815" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1815.">[1815]</a>
and marched up by way of Neubourg and Vaudreuil,
both of which he captured, to besiege Rouen. Thence,
however, he again retired—scared, it may be, by tidings
of Richard’s approach—and hurrying back to the southern
border laid siege to Verneuil on May 10.<a id="Anchor_1816" href="#Footnote_1816" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1816.">[1816]</a> Two days later<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">ii.365</a></span>
Richard landed at Barfleur,<a id="Anchor_1817" href="#Footnote_1817" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1817.">[1817]</a> and by the end of another
fortnight he was encamped at L’Aigle,<a id="Anchor_1818" href="#Footnote_1818" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1818.">[1818]</a> within a few miles
of Verneuil. His presence there, coupled with the defection
of John who had contrived to join him on the road,<a id="Anchor_1819" href="#Footnote_1819" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1819.">[1819]</a> and
the surprise and slaughter of the French garrison of Evreux
by a body of Norman troops,<a id="Anchor_1820" href="#Footnote_1820" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1820.">[1820]</a> alarmed Philip so much that
on Whitsun Eve, May 28, he again fled into his own
dominions.<a id="Anchor_1821" href="#Footnote_1821" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1821.">[1821]</a> Richard was busy strengthening the walls of
Verneuil when tidings came to him that “the Angevins
and Cenomannians” were besieging Montmirail,<a id="Anchor_1822" href="#Footnote_1822" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1822.">[1822]</a> a castle on
the borders of Perche and Maine, famous as the scene of
a stormy conference between Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas.
Who the besiegers actually were, or what was the ground
of their hostility either to William of Montmirail<a id="Anchor_1823" href="#Footnote_1823" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1823.">[1823]</a> or to his
overlord King Richard, must remain undecided. It is
plain, however, that in Richard’s ears the tidings sounded as
a warning of disaffection in his patrimonial dominions. He
hurried to the relief of Montmirail, but found it levelled with
the ground.<a id="Anchor_1824" href="#Footnote_1824" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1824.">[1824]</a> He wasted no time in pursuit of its destroyers,
but pushed on direct to Tours, took up his quarters in
Châteauneuf,<a id="Anchor_1825" href="#Footnote_1825" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1825.">[1825]</a> and shewed his suspicions concerning the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">ii.366</a></span>
origin of the new mischief by driving the canons of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>

protection of the French king.<a id="Anchor_1826" href="#Footnote_1826" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1826.">[1826]</a> The burghers, on the other
hand, made proof of their loyalty by a free-will offering
of two thousand marks.<a id="Anchor_1827" href="#Footnote_1827" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1827.">[1827]</a> Determined now to redeem his
pledges to Philip not with gold but with steel, Richard
marched on to Beaulieu,<a id="Anchor_1828" href="#Footnote_1828" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1828.">[1828]</a> to join a body of Navarrese and
Brabantines, sent by his brother-in-law Sancho of Navarre,
in blockading the castle of Loches;<a id="Anchor_1829" href="#Footnote_1829" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1829.">[1829]</a> a few days after his
arrival, on June 13, it was surrendered by its French
garrison.<a id="Anchor_1830" href="#Footnote_1830" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1830.">[1830]</a> He was however standing between two fires.
Bertrand de Born was again stirring up the south, singing
and fighting ostensibly in Richard’s interest against his
disaffected neighbours in the Limousin, but in reality kindling
into a fresh blaze all the reckless passions and endless
feuds which had been smouldering too long for the warrior-poet’s
pleasure.<a id="Anchor_1831" href="#Footnote_1831" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1831.">[1831]</a> Philip meanwhile was again threatening
Rouen;<a id="Anchor_1832" href="#Footnote_1832" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1832.">[1832]</a> the Norman archbishop and seneschal attempted to
negotiate with him in Richard’s name, but without result;<a id="Anchor_1833" href="#Footnote_1833" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1833.">[1833]</a>
and at the end of the month he marched southward to meet
Richard himself. On July 4 the two kings were within
a few miles of each other—Richard at Vendôme, Philip at
Fréteval.<a id="Anchor_1834" href="#Footnote_1834" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1834.">[1834]</a> What followed is told so diversely by the English
and French historians of the time that it seems impossible
to reconcile the rival accounts or to decide between them.
All that we know for certain is that Philip suddenly struck
his tents and withdrew into the territories of the count of
Blois; that Richard set off in pursuit, missed Philip himself,
but fell at unawares upon the troops who were convoying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">ii.367</a></span>
his baggage towards Blois, routed them, and captured all
the French king’s most precious possessions, including his
royal seal and the treasury-rolls of the whole kingdom,
besides a number of valuable horses, an immense quantity
of money and plate, and—what would be scarcely less useful
to Richard for political purposes—the charters of agreement
between Philip and all the Norman, Angevin and Poitevin
rebels who had plotted treason with him and John against
their lord.<a id="Anchor_1835" href="#Footnote_1835" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1835.">[1835]</a></p>

In the hands of the poet William of Armorica it becomes
a horrible romance, wherein John, as commandant of Evreux, invites the unsuspecting
Frenchmen to a banquet, and then brings in his “armed Englishmen” to
massacre them

John has so many undoubted crimes to answer for that it probably seemed a mere trifle
to add one more to the list, but for that very reason one cannot admit it on the
sole testimony of the poet-historiographer. The English writers say nothing of
the whole matter.

<p>The repairing of this disaster gave Philip sufficient occupation
for the rest of the year, and Richard was free to
march upon the Aquitanian rebels. Sancho of Navarre was
already wasting the lands of the ringleaders, Geoffrey of
Rancogne and Ademar of Angoulême;<a id="Anchor_1836" href="#Footnote_1836" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1836.">[1836]</a> and by July 22
Richard was able to report to his justiciar in England that
he was master of all the castles of the Angoumois and all
the lands of Geoffrey.<a id="Anchor_1837" href="#Footnote_1837" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1837.">[1837]</a> From Angoulême he marched northward
again, took measures for the security of Anjou and
Maine,<a id="Anchor_1838" href="#Footnote_1838" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1838.">[1838]</a> and then returned to Normandy, where he found
that his representatives, headed by the chancellor, had just
concluded a truce with the French king to last till All
Saints’ day<a id="Anchor_1839" href="#Footnote_1839" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1839.">[1839]</a>—a proceeding which served him as the pretext
for that withdrawal of the seal from William and repudiation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">ii.368</a></span>
of all engagements made under it, which has been mentioned
already.<a id="Anchor_1840" href="#Footnote_1840" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1840.">[1840]</a> No further movement was however made by either
party until the spring. Then the wearisome story of fruitless
negotiations alternating with indecisive warfare begins
again, and goes on unceasingly for the next four years.
Save for an occasional attempt to make a diversion in Berry,
the actual fighting between the two kings was confined to
the Norman border.<a id="Anchor_1841" href="#Footnote_1841" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1841.">[1841]</a> Normandy was the chief object of
Philip’s attack, partly no doubt because, owing to its
geographical position, he could invade it with more ease
and less risk than any other part of Richard’s dominions,
but also because it was the key to all the rest. A French
conquest of Normandy would sever Richard’s communications
not only with Flanders and Germany, but also with
England; and the strength of the Angevins in Gaul now
rested chiefly upon the support of their island-realm.
Neither assailant nor defender, however, was able to gain
any decisive advantage in the field. The armed struggle
between them was in fact of less importance than the
diplomatic rivalry which they carried on side by side with
it; and in this, strangely enough, Richard, who had hitherto
shewn so little of the far-sighted statecraft and political
tact of his race, proved more than a match for his wily
antagonist.</p>

<p>That the foes in Richard’s own household should league
themselves against him with Philip, as he had done in earlier
days against his own father, was, so far as Richard himself
is concerned, no more than retributive justice. Philip’s
alliance with John had proved a failure; but it was not
long before he saw a chance of securing a more useful tool
in the person of little Arthur of Britanny. English historians
tell us that when Richard and Philip made their treaty
at Messina in March 1191 Richard obtained a formal
acknowledgement of his rights, as duke of Normandy, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">ii.369</a></span>
overlordship of Britanny and the liege homage of its duke.<a id="Anchor_1842" href="#Footnote_1842" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1842.">[1842]</a>
The text of the treaty of Messina, however, contains not a
word on this subject; the agreement, if made at all, must
have been drawn up in a separate form; and it seems to
have remained a dead letter, like another agreement made
at the same place a few months earlier—the treaty with
Tancred whereby Richard had engaged to recognize Arthur
of Britanny as his successor in default of direct heirs.
Although after five years of marriage Queen Berengaria was
still childless, no such recognition had yet been made.
Richard on his return to Europe probably perceived that
Arthur’s succession would be impossible in England, and in
Gaul would be fatal to the independence of the Angevin
house. Accordingly, he was once more doing all in his
power to win the attachment of John; and John, having at
length discovered that his own interests could be better
served by supporting his brother than by intriguing against
him, proved an active and useful ally in the war against
Philip.<a id="Anchor_1843" href="#Footnote_1843" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1843.">[1843]</a> On the other hand, Richard seems never to have
received Arthur’s homage for Britanny; and those who had
the control of political affairs in that country were determined
that he never should. The dispute between Henry
and Philip for the wardship of the two children of Geoffrey
and Constance had apparently ended in a compromise.
Eleanor, the elder child, was now under the care of her
uncle Richard;<a id="Anchor_1844" href="#Footnote_1844" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1844.">[1844]</a> but Constance seems to have succeeded in
keeping her infant boy out of the reach of both his
would-be guardians, and, moreover, in governing her duchy
without any reference to either of them, for nearly seven
years after the death of her father-in-law King Henry.
She had been given in marriage by him, when scarcely
twelve months a widow, to Earl Ralf of Chester,<a id="Anchor_1845" href="#Footnote_1845" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1845.">[1845]</a> son and
successor of Earl Hugh who had been one of the leaders in
the revolt of 1173. As the earls of Chester were hereditary
viscounts of the Avranchin—the border-district of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">ii.370</a></span>
Normandy and Britanny—this marriage would have furnished
an excellent means of securing the Norman hold
upon the Breton duchy, if only Ralf himself could have
secured a hold upon his wife. In this however he completely
failed. Safe in her hereditary dominions, with her
boy at her side, and strong in the support of her people
rejoicing in their newly-regained independence, Constance
apparently set Ralf, Richard and Philip all alike at defiance,
till in 1196 Richard summoned her to a conference with himself
in Normandy, and she set out to obey the summons.
Scarcely had she touched the soil of the Avranchin at
Pontorson when she was caught by her husband and imprisoned
in his castle of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> James-de-Beuvron.<a id="Anchor_1846" href="#Footnote_1846" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1846.">[1846]</a> It is hard
not to suspect that Richard and Ralf had plotted the
capture between them; for Richard, instead of insisting
upon her release, at once renewed his claim to the wardship
of Arthur, and prepared to enforce it at the sword’s point.
The Bretons first hurried their young duke away to the
innermost fastnesses of their wild and desolate country under
the care of the bishop of Vannes,<a id="Anchor_1847" href="#Footnote_1847" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1847.">[1847]</a> and then, after a vain
attempt to liberate his mother, intrusted him to the protection
of the king of France,<a id="Anchor_1848" href="#Footnote_1848" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1848.">[1848]</a> who of course received him
with open arms, and sent him to be educated with his own
son.<a id="Anchor_1849" href="#Footnote_1849" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1849.">[1849]</a></p>

<p>Philip had now got the old Angevin patrimony between
two fires; but the Bretons were so little accustomed to act
in concert even among themselves, far less with any other
power, that he found it impossible to make any real use of
them as allies either for military or political purposes. The
independent warfare which they carried on with Richard
across the south-western border of Normandy<a id="Anchor_1850" href="#Footnote_1850" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1850.">[1850]</a> had little
effect upon that which Richard and Philip were carrying on
along its eastern border; and upon the Angevin lands which
lay directly between Britanny and France the Breton revolt
had no effect at all. To the end of Richard’s life, we hear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">ii.371</a></span>
of no further troubles in Maine or Anjou. Nay more, we
hear of no further troubles in Aquitaine. If Philip had in
some sense turned Richard’s flank in the west, Richard had
turned Philip’s flank far more effectually in the south. The
unwonted tranquillity there may indeed have been partly due
to the fact that one of the chief sources of disturbance was
removed in 1196 by the withdrawal of Bertrand de Born
into a monastery;<a id="Anchor_1851" href="#Footnote_1851" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1851.">[1851]</a> but it was also in great measure owing
to Richard’s quickness in seizing an opportunity which
presented itself, in that same eventful year, of forming a
lasting alliance with the house of Toulouse. His old enemy
Count Raymond <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr> was dead;<a id="Anchor_1852" href="#Footnote_1852" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1852.">[1852]</a> he now offered the hand of
his own favourite sister, the still young and handsome Queen
Jane of Sicily, to the new Count Raymond <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr>;<a id="Anchor_1853" href="#Footnote_1853" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1853.">[1853]</a> and thenceforth
the eastern frontier of his Aquitanian duchy was as secure
under the protection of his sister’s husband as its southern
frontier under that of his wife’s brother, the king of Navarre.</p>

<p>Nor were Richard’s alliances confined within the boundaries
of Gaul. His year of captivity in Germany had not
been all wasted time. When he parted from his imperial
jailor in the spring of 1194, they were, at any rate in outward
semblance, close political allies; and at the same time
Richard had succeeded in gaining over his bitterest foe,
Leopold of Austria, by an offer of his niece Eleanor of
Britanny as wife to Leopold’s son.<a id="Anchor_1854" href="#Footnote_1854" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1854.">[1854]</a> The marriage-contract
was however not yet executed when the Austrian duke met
with a fatal accident and died in agony, owning with his
last breath that his miserable end was a just retribution for
his conduct towards the English king.<a id="Anchor_1855" href="#Footnote_1855" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1855.">[1855]</a> The impression
made by this event deepened the feeling of respect and awe
which the captive lion had already contrived to inspire in
the princes of the Empire. Meanwhile Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">ii.372</a></span>
made himself master of Sicily;<a id="Anchor_1856" href="#Footnote_1856" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1856.">[1856]</a> and now the old dream by
which the German Emperors never quite ceased to be
haunted, the dream of re-asserting their imperial supremacy
over Gaul, was beginning to shape itself anew in his brain.
In the summer of 1195 he sent to Richard a golden crown
and a message charging him, on his plighted faith to the
Emperor and on the very lives of his hostages, to invade
the French kingdom at once, and promising him the support
and co-operation of the imperial forces. Richard, suspecting
a trap, despatched William of Longchamp to inquire into
the exact nature, extent and security of Henry’s promised
assistance; Philip vainly tried to intercept the envoy as he
passed through the royal domains;<a id="Anchor_1857" href="#Footnote_1857" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1857.">[1857]</a> and the negotiations
proved so far effectual that Henry remitted seventeen
thousand marks out of the ransom, as a contribution to
Richard’s expenses in his struggle with Philip.<a id="Anchor_1858" href="#Footnote_1858" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1858.">[1858]</a> When, on
Michaelmas Eve 1197, Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> died,<a id="Anchor_1859" href="#Footnote_1859" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1859.">[1859]</a> the use of that
homage on Richard’s part which his English subjects had
resented so bitterly was made apparent to them at last.
While the English king was holding his Christmas court at
Rouen there came to him an embassy from the princes of
Germany, summoning him, as chief among the lay members
of the Empire<a id="Anchor_1860" href="#Footnote_1860" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1860.">[1860]</a> by virtue of his investiture with the kingdom
of Arles, to take part with them in the election of a new
Emperor at Cöln on February 22.<a id="Anchor_1861" href="#Footnote_1861" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1861.">[1861]</a> Richard himself could
not venture to leave Gaul; but the issue proved that his
presence at Cöln was not needed to secure his interests
there. He wished that the imperial crown should be given
to his nephew Duke Henry of Saxony, eldest son and successor
of Henry the Lion. This scheme, however, when
laid before the other electors by the envoys whom he sent
to represent him at Cöln, was rejected on account of the
duke’s absence in Holy Land.<a id="Anchor_1862" href="#Footnote_1862" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1862.">[1862]</a> The representatives of the
English king then proposed Henry’s brother Otto, for whom
Richard had long been vainly endeavouring to find satisfactory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">ii.373</a></span>
provision on either side of the sea,<a id="Anchor_1863" href="#Footnote_1863" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1863.">[1863]</a> and who seems
really to have been his favourite nephew. The result was
that, on the appointed day, Otto was elected Emperor of the
Romans,<a id="Anchor_1864" href="#Footnote_1864" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1864.">[1864]</a> and on July 12 he was crowned king of the
Germans at Aachen by the archbishop of Cöln.<a id="Anchor_1865" href="#Footnote_1865" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1865.">[1865]</a></p>

<p>For a moment, at the mere prospect of beholding a
grandson of Henry Fitz-Empress seated upon the imperial
throne of the west, there had flashed across the mind of at
least one friend of the Angevin house a fancy that the world-wide
dominion which seemed to be passing away from the
heirs of Fulk the Good was to be renewed for yet one more
generation.<a id="Anchor_1866" href="#Footnote_1866" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1866.">[1866]</a> There was indeed an opposition party in
Germany, who set up a rival Emperor in the person of
Philip of Suabia, a brother of Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr>;<a id="Anchor_1867" href="#Footnote_1867" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1867.">[1867]</a> and he at once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">ii.374</a></span>
made common cause with his French namesake.<a id="Anchor_1868" href="#Footnote_1868" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1868.">[1868]</a> This
Suabian alliance, however, and the support of the count of
Ponthieu—purchased two years before with the hand of the
unhappy Adela, whom Richard had at last restored to her
brother<a id="Anchor_1869" href="#Footnote_1869" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1869.">[1869]</a>—could not much avail Philip Augustus against
such a league as was now gathering around the English
king. The vast sums which Hubert Walter had been sending,
year after year, to his royal master over sea were
bringing a goodly interest at last. Flanders, Britanny,
Champagne, had all been secretly detached from the French
alliance and bought over to the service of Richard;<a id="Anchor_1870" href="#Footnote_1870" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1870.">[1870]</a> the
Flemish count had already drawn Philip into a war in which
he narrowly escaped being made prisoner;<a id="Anchor_1871" href="#Footnote_1871" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1871.">[1871]</a> and in the summer
of 1198, when the imperial election was over, not only Baldwin
of Flanders, Reginald of Boulogne, Baldwin of Guines, Henry
of Louvain, Everard of Brienne, Geoffrey of Perche and Raymond
of Toulouse, but even the young count Louis of Blois
and the boy-duke Arthur of Britanny himself, one and all
leagued themselves in an offensive and defensive alliance with
Richard against the French king.<a id="Anchor_1872" href="#Footnote_1872" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1872.">[1872]</a> The immediate consequence
was that Philip begged Hubert Walter, who being just released
from his justiciarship had rejoined his sovereign in Normandy,
to make peace for him with Richard; and he even went so far
as to offer the surrender of all the Norman castles which he had
won, except Gisors. Richard however would listen to no terms
in which his allies were not included.<a id="Anchor_1873" href="#Footnote_1873" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1873.">[1873]</a> At last, in November,
a truce was made, to last till the usual term, <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Hilary’s day.<a id="Anchor_1874" href="#Footnote_1874" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1874.">[1874]</a>
When it expired the two kings held a colloquy on the Seine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">ii.375</a></span>
between Vernon and Les Andelys, Richard in a boat on the
river, Philip on horseback on the shore;<a id="Anchor_1875" href="#Footnote_1875" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1875.">[1875]</a> this meeting was
followed by another, where, by the mediation of a cardinal-legate,
Peter of Capua, who had lately arrived in Gaul, they
were persuaded to prolong their truce for five years.<a id="Anchor_1876" href="#Footnote_1876" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1876.">[1876]</a></p>

In the latter place he adds: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod quondam

“looks like an anticipation of the election of Otto <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr> to the empire<span class="dots">...</span>. As
Bishop Longchamp died in 1197, before which date we must suppose <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> R

    <cite><abbr title="Gervase of Canterbury">Gerv. Cant.</abbr>, Stubbs, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 543</cite>),
it seems indeed to shew that the possibility of one or other of
Richard’s nephews becoming Emperor at the next vacancy was already in contemplation
more than eight months before the death of Henry <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> Or was Ralf
dreaming rather of a transfer of the imperial crown to Richard himself? for it is
to be observed that Otto can be included within the “nine generations” only by
excluding from them Fulk the Good himself; but this mode of computing would
fail if applied to the eastern branch of the Angevin house, where it would give
only eight generations, so that we can hardly suppose it to have been adopted by
Ralf. According to
    <cite><abbr title="Ralph of">R. Coggeshall</abbr> (Stevenson), <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 88</cite>,
and

a party among the electors actually did choose Richard, and—much more
strangely—another party chose Philip of France.

<p>Yet all the while, there lurked in Richard’s heart a misgiving
that, in the last resort, his diplomacy would prove to
have been in vain; that, strive as he might to turn away
the tide of war from his own borders by stirring up north
and east and south to overwhelm the Crown of France, still,
after all, the day must come when the Angevins would have
to stake their political existence solely upon their own
military resources, and to stand at bay, unaided, unsupported,
alone, behind whatever bulwark they might be able
to devise by their own military genius. It was the genius
and the foresight of Richard himself which insured that
when the crisis came, the bulwark was ready, even though
it were doomed to prove unavailing in the end. The last
and mightiest of the many mighty fortresses reared by
Angevin hands since the first great builder of the race had
begun his castle-building in the Loire valley was the Château-Gaillard,
the “saucy castle” of Richard the Lion-heart. He
“fixed its site where the Seine bends suddenly at Gaillon in
a great semicircle to the north, and where the valley of Les
Andelys breaks the line of the chalk cliffs along its banks.
Blue masses of woodland crown the distant hills; within the
river curve lies a dull reach of flat meadow, round which the
Seine, broken with green islets and dappled with the grey
and blue of the sky, flashes like a silver bow on its way to
Rouen.”<a id="Anchor_1877" href="#Footnote_1877" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1877.">[1877]</a> Some three-quarters of a league from the right
bank of the river, in a valley opening upon it from the eastward
and watered by the little stream of Gambon, stood the
town of Andely. Between the town and the river stretched
a lake, or rather perhaps a marsh,<a id="Anchor_1878" href="#Footnote_1878" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1878.">[1878]</a> through which the Gambon
and another lesser rivulet descending from the hills to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">ii.376</a></span>
the north of Andely found their way by two separate issues
into the Seine, nearly opposite two islets, of which the larger
and more northerly was known as the Isle of Andely.<a id="Anchor_1879" href="#Footnote_1879" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1879.">[1879]</a> The
space enclosed between the three rivers and the marsh seems
to have been a tract of waste land, occupied only by a toll-house
for the collection of dues from the vessels passing up
and down the Seine<a id="Anchor_1880" href="#Footnote_1880" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1880.">[1880]</a>—dues which formed one of the most
important items in the revenue of the archbishop of Rouen,
to whom Andely and its neighbourhood belonged.<a id="Anchor_1881" href="#Footnote_1881" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1881.">[1881]</a> Over
against this spot, on the southern bank of the Gambon, in
the angle formed by its junction with the Seine, a mass of
limestone crag rose abruptly to the height of three hundred
feet. Its western side, almost perpendicular, looked down
upon the great river, the northern, scarcely less steep, over
the Gambon and the lake beyond; to the north-east and
south-west its rocky slopes died down into deep ravines, and
only a narrow neck of land at its south-eastern extremity
connected it with the lofty plateau covered with a dense
woodland known as the Forest of Andely, which stretches
along the eastern side of the Seine valley between Andely
and Gaillon. One glance at the site was enough to rivet a
soldier’s gaze. If, instead of the metropolitan church of
Normandy, a lay baron had owned the soil of Andely, we
may be sure that long ago that lofty brow would have
received its fitting crown; if the power of Fulk the Builder
had reached to the banks of the Seine, we may doubt whether
the anathemas of the Norman primate would not have
availed as little to wrest such a spot from his grasp as those
of the archbishop of Tours had availed to wrest from him
the site of Montrichard. But a greater castle-builder than
Fulk Nerra himself was the architect of Château-Gaillard.</p>

<p>Richard’s historical connexion with the “rock of Andely”
has its ill-omened beginning in a ghastly story of the fate of
three French prisoners whom he flung from its summit into
the ravine below, in vengeance for the slaughter of some
Welsh auxiliaries who had been surprised and cut to pieces
by the French king’s troops in the neighbouring valley.<a id="Anchor_1882" href="#Footnote_1882" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1882.">[1882]</a>
By the opening of 1196, however, he had devised for it a
more honourable use. In a treaty with Philip, drawn up in
January of that year, the fief of Andely was made the subject
of special provisions whereby it was reserved as a sort
of neutral zone between the territories of the two kings, and
a significant clause was added: “Andely shall not be fortified.”<a id="Anchor_1883" href="#Footnote_1883" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1883.">[1883]</a>
As by the same treaty the older bulwarks of
Normandy—Nonancourt, Ivry, Pacy, Vernon, Gaillon, Neufmarché,
Gisors—were resigned into Philip’s hands, this
clause, if strictly fulfilled, would have left the Seine without
a barrier and Rouen at the mercy of the French king. The
agreement in short, like all those which bore the signatures
of Philip and Richard, was made only to be broken; both
parties broke it without delay; and while Philip was forming
his league with the Bretons for the ruin of Anjou, Richard
was tracing out in the valley of the Gambon and on the
rock of Andely the plan of a line of fortifications which were
to interpose an insurmountable barrier between his Norman
capital and the French invader. His first act was to seize
the Isle of Andely.<a id="Anchor_1884" href="#Footnote_1884" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1884.">[1884]</a> Here he built a lofty octagonal tower,
encircled by a ditch and rampart, and threw a bridge over
the river from each side of the island, linking it thus to
either shore.<a id="Anchor_1885" href="#Footnote_1885" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1885.">[1885]</a> On the right, beyond the eastern bridge, he
traced out the walls of a new town, which took the name of
the New or the Lesser Andely,<a id="Anchor_1886" href="#Footnote_1886" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1886.">[1886]</a> a secure stronghold whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">ii.378</a></span>
artificial defences of ramparts and towers were surrounded
by the further protection of the lake on its eastern side, the
Seine on the west, and the two lesser rivers to north and
south, a bridge spanning each of these two little streams
forming the sole means of access from the mainland.<a id="Anchor_1887" href="#Footnote_1887" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1887.">[1887]</a> The
southern bridge, that over the Gambon, linked this New
Andely with the foot of the rock which was to be crowned
with the mightiest work of all. Richard began by digging
out to a yet greater depth the ravines which parted this
rock from the surrounding heights, so as to make it wholly
inaccessible save by the one connecting isthmus at its south-eastern
extremity. On its summit, which formed a plateau
some six hundred feet in length and two hundred in breadth
at the widest part, he reared a triple fortress. The outer
ward consisted of a triangular enclosure; its apex, facing the
isthmus already mentioned, was crowned by a large round
tower,<a id="Anchor_1888" href="#Footnote_1888" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1888.">[1888]</a> with walls ten feet in thickness; the extremities of
its base were strengthened by similar towers, and two
smaller ones broke the line of the connecting curtain-wall.
This was surrounded by a ditch dug in the rock to a depth
of more than forty feet, and having a perpendicular counterscarp.
Fronting the base of this outer fortress across the
ditch on its north-western side was a rampart surmounted
by a wall ninety feet long and eight feet thick, also flanked
by two round towers; from these a similar wall ran all
round the edges of the plateau, where the steep sides of the
rock itself took the place of rampart and ditch. The wall
on the south-west side—the river-front—was broken by
another tower, cylindrical without, octagonal within; and its
northern extremity was protected by two mighty rectangular
bastions. Close against one of these stood a round tower,
which served as the base of a third enclosure, the heart and
citadel of the whole fortress. Two-thirds of its elliptical
outline, on the east and south, were formed by a succession
of semicircular bastions, or segments of towers, seventeen in
number, each parted from its neighbour by scarcely more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">ii.379</a></span>
than two feet of curtain-wall—an arrangement apparently
imitated from the fortress of Cherbourg, which was accounted
the greatest marvel of military architecture in Normandy,
until its fame was eclipsed by that of Richard’s work.<a id="Anchor_1889" href="#Footnote_1889" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1889.">[1889]</a> This
portion of the enclosure was built upon a rampart formed
by the excavation of a ditch about fifteen to twenty feet in
width; the counterscarp, like that of the outer ditches, was
perpendicular; and a series of casemates cut in the rock ran
along on this side for a distance of about eighty feet. On
the western side of the citadel stood the keep, a mighty
circular tower, with walls of the thickness of twelve feet,
terminating at an angle of twenty feet in depth where it
projected into the enclosure; it had two or perhaps three
stages,<a id="Anchor_1890" href="#Footnote_1890" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1890.">[1890]</a> and was lighted by two great arched windows,
whence the eye could range at will over the wooded hills
and dales of the Vexin, or the winding course of the river
broadening onward to Rouen. Behind the keep was placed
the principal dwelling-house, and under this a staircase cut
out of the rock gave access to an underground passage
leading to some outworks and a tower near the foot of the
hill, whence a wall was carried down to the river-bank, just
beyond the northern extremity of a long narrow island
known as the “isle of the Three Kings”—doubtless from
some one of the many meetings held in this district by
Louis <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr> or Philip Augustus and the two Henrys.<a id="Anchor_1891" href="#Footnote_1891" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1891.">[1891]</a> The
river itself was barred by a double stockade, crossing its bed
from shore to shore.<a id="Anchor_1892" href="#Footnote_1892" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1892.">[1892]</a></p>

<p>All this work was accomplished within a single year.<a id="Anchor_1893" href="#Footnote_1893" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1893.">[1893]</a>
Richard, who had watched over its progress with unremitting
care, broke into an ecstasy of delight at its completion; he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">ii.380</a></span>
called his barons to see “how fair a child was his, this child
but a twelvemonth old”;<a id="Anchor_1894" href="#Footnote_1894" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1894.">[1894]</a> he called it his “saucy castle,”
“Château-Gaillard,”<a id="Anchor_1895" href="#Footnote_1895" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1895.">[1895]</a> and the name which he thus gave it in
jest soon replaced in popular speech its more formal title of
“the Castle on the Rock of Andely.”<a id="Anchor_1896" href="#Footnote_1896" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1896.">[1896]</a> The hardness of the
rock out of which the fortifications were hewn was not the sole
obstacle against which the royal builder had had to contend.
Richard had no more thought than Fulk Nerra would have
had of asking the primate’s leave before beginning to build
upon his land; the work therefore was no sooner begun
than Archbishop Walter lifted up his protest against it;
obtaining no redress, he laid Normandy under interdict and
carried his complaint in person to the Pope.<a id="Anchor_1897" href="#Footnote_1897" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1897.">[1897]</a> Richard at
once sent envoys to appeal against the interdict and make
arrangements for the settlement of the dispute.<a id="Anchor_1898" href="#Footnote_1898" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1898.">[1898]</a> Meanwhile,
however, he pushed on the building without delay.
Like Fulk of old, the seeming wrath of Heaven moved him
as little as that of its earthly representatives; a rain of blood
which fell upon the workmen and the king himself, though
it scared all beside, failed to shake his determination; “if an
angel had come down out of the sky to bid him stay his
hand, he would have got no answer but a curse.”<a id="Anchor_1899" href="#Footnote_1899" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1899.">[1899]</a> He had
now, however, made his peace with the Church; in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">ii.381</a></span>
spring of 1197 he offered to the archbishop an exchange of
land on terms highly advantageous to the metropolitan see;
and on this condition the Pope raised the interdict in May
of the same year.<a id="Anchor_1900" href="#Footnote_1900" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1900.">[1900]</a> The exchange was carried through on
October 16,<a id="Anchor_1901" href="#Footnote_1901" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1901.">[1901]</a> and ratified by John in a separate charter, a
step which seems to indicate that John was now recognized
as his brother’s heir.<a id="Anchor_1902" href="#Footnote_1902" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1902.">[1902]</a></p>

<p>It was probably about the same time that the treaty
with Flanders, the corner-stone of the league which Richard
was forming against the king of France, was signed within
the walls of the new fortress.<a id="Anchor_1903" href="#Footnote_1903" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1903.">[1903]</a> Yet, as has been already
seen, the coalition was not fully organized till late in the
following summer; and even then the complicated weapon
hung fire. Want of money seems to have been Richard’s
chief difficulty, now as ever—a difficulty which after Hubert
Walter’s defeat in the council at Oxford and his resignation
in the following July must have seemed well-nigh insurmountable.
At last, however, in the spring of 1199, a ray
of hope came from a quarter where it was wholly unexpected.
Richard was leading his mercenaries through Poitou to
check the viscount of Limoges and the count of Angoulême
in a renewal of their treasonable designs<a id="Anchor_1904" href="#Footnote_1904" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1904.">[1904]</a> when he was met<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382">ii.382</a></span>
by rumours of a marvellous discovery at Châlus in the
Limousin. A peasant working on the land of Achard, the
lord of Châlus, was said to have turned up with his plough
a treasure<a id="Anchor_1905" href="#Footnote_1905" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1905.">[1905]</a> which popular imagination pictured as nothing
less than “an emperor with his wife, sons and daughters, all
of pure gold, and seated round a golden table.”<a id="Anchor_1906" href="#Footnote_1906" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1906.">[1906]</a> In vain
did Achard seek to keep his secret and his prize to himself.
Treasure-trove was a right of the overlord, and it seems to
have been at once claimed by the viscount Ademar of
Limoges, as Achard’s immediate superior. His claim, however,
had to give way to that of his own overlord, King
Richard; but when he sent to the king the share which he
had himself wrung from Achard, Richard indignantly rejected
it, vowing that he would have all. This Achard and
Ademar both refused, and the king laid siege to Châlus.<a id="Anchor_1907" href="#Footnote_1907" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1907.">[1907]</a></p>

<p>This place, not far from the western border of the
Limousin, is now represented by two villages, known conjointly
as Châlus-Chabrol, and built upon the summits of
two low hills, at whose foot winds the little stream of Tardoire.
Each hill is crowned by a round tower of late twelfth-century
work; the lower one is traditionally said to be the
keep of the fortress besieged by Richard with all his forces
at Mid-Lent 1199.<a id="Anchor_1908" href="#Footnote_1908" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1908.">[1908]</a> In vain did Achard, who was utterly
unprepared to stand a siege, protest his innocence and offer
to submit to the judgement of the French king’s court, as
supreme alike over the duke of Aquitaine and over his
vassals; in vain did he beg for a truce till the holy season<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383">ii.383</a></span>
should be past; in vain, when the outworks were almost
wholly destroyed and the keep itself undermined,<a id="Anchor_1909" href="#Footnote_1909" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1909.">[1909]</a> did he
ask leave to surrender with the honours of war for himself
and his men. Richard was inexorable; he swore that he
would hang them all.<a id="Anchor_1910" href="#Footnote_1910" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1910.">[1910]</a> With the courage that is born of
despair, Achard, accompanied by six knights and nine
serving-men, retired into the keep, determined to hold it
until death.<a id="Anchor_1911" href="#Footnote_1911" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1911.">[1911]</a> All that day—Friday, March 26<a id="Anchor_1912" href="#Footnote_1912" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1912.">[1912]</a>—Richard
and his lieutenant Mercadier, the captain of his mercenaries,<a id="Anchor_1913" href="#Footnote_1913" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1913.">[1913]</a>
prowled vainly round the walls, seeking for a point at which
they could assault them with safety.<a id="Anchor_1914" href="#Footnote_1914" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1914.">[1914]</a> Their sappers were
all the while undermining the tower.<a id="Anchor_1915" href="#Footnote_1915" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1915.">[1915]</a> Its defenders, finding
themselves short of missiles, began throwing down beams
of wood and fragments of the broken battlements at the
miners’ heads.<a id="Anchor_1916" href="#Footnote_1916" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1916.">[1916]</a> They were equally short of defensive arms;
one of the little band stood for more than half the day upon
a turret, with nothing but a frying-pan for a shield against
the bolts which flew whistling all around him, yet failed to
drive him from his post.<a id="Anchor_1917" href="#Footnote_1917" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1917.">[1917]</a> At last the moment came for
which he had been waiting so long and so bravely. Just as
Richard, unarmed save for his iron head-piece, paused within<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">ii.384</a></span>
bow-shot of the turret, this man caught sight of an arrow
which had been shot at himself from the besieging ranks—seemingly,
indeed, by Richard’s own hand—and had stuck
harmlessly in a crevice of the wall within his reach. He
snatched it out, fitted it to his cross-bow, and aimed at
the king.<a id="Anchor_1918" href="#Footnote_1918" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1918.">[1918]</a> Richard saw the movement and greeted it with
a shout of defiant applause; he failed to shelter himself
under his buckler; the arrow struck him on the left shoulder,
just below the joint of the neck, and glancing downwards
penetrated deep into his side.<a id="Anchor_1919" href="#Footnote_1919" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1919.">[1919]</a> He made light of the wound,<a id="Anchor_1920" href="#Footnote_1920" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1920.">[1920]</a>
gave strict orders to Mercadier to press the assault with redoubled
vigour,<a id="Anchor_1921" href="#Footnote_1921" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1921.">[1921]</a> and rode back to his tent as if nothing was
amiss.<a id="Anchor_1922" href="#Footnote_1922" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1922.">[1922]</a> There he rashly tried to pull out the arrow with
his own hand.<a id="Anchor_1923" href="#Footnote_1923" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1923.">[1923]</a> The wood broke off, the iron barb remained
fixed in the wound; a surgeon attached to the staff of
Mercadier was sent for, and endeavoured to cut it out; unluckily,
Richard was fat like his father, and the iron, buried
deep in his flesh, was so difficult to reach that the injuries
caused by the operator’s knife proved more dangerous than
that which had been inflicted by the shaft of the hostile
crossbow-man.<a id="Anchor_1924" href="#Footnote_1924" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1924.">[1924]</a> The wounded side grew more swollen and

The writers of his own time call him “Marcadeus,” “Mercaderius,” in every possible
variety of spelling; in a charter of his own, printed by
    <cite>Géraud (as above, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>

“Mercadier,” which Géraud uses. He was a Provençal by birth

<p>Then Richard, face to face with death, came to his better
self once more, and prepared calmly and bravely for his end.
Until then he had suffered no one to enter the chamber
where he lay save four barons whom he specially trusted,
lest the report of his sickness should be bruited about,<a id="Anchor_1927" href="#Footnote_1927" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1927.">[1927]</a> to
discourage his friends or to rejoice his foes. Now, he
summoned all of his followers who were within reach to
witness his solemn bequest of all his dominions to his brother
John, and made them swear fealty to John as his successor.<a id="Anchor_1928" href="#Footnote_1928" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1928.">[1928]</a>
He wrote to his mother, who was at Fontevraud, requesting
her to come to him;<a id="Anchor_1929" href="#Footnote_1929" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1929.">[1929]</a> he bequeathed his jewels to his nephew
King Otto, and a fourth part of his treasures to be distributed
among his servants and the poor.<a id="Anchor_1930" href="#Footnote_1930" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1930.">[1930]</a> By this time
Châlus was taken and its garrison hung, according to his
earlier orders—all save the man who had shot him, and who
had apparently been reserved for his special judgement.
Richard ordered the man to be brought before him. “What
have I done to thee,” he asked him, “that thou shouldest
slay me?” “Thou hast slain my father and two of my
brothers with thine own hand, and thou wouldst fain have
killed me too. Avenge thyself upon me as thou wilt; I will
gladly endure the greatest torments which thou canst devise,
since I have seen thee upon thy death-bed.” “I forgive
thee,” answered Richard, and he bade the guards loose him
and let him go free with a gift of a hundred shillings.<a id="Anchor_1931" href="#Footnote_1931" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1931.">[1931]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386">ii.386</a></span>
story went that Richard had not communicated for nearly
seven years, because he could not put himself in charity with
Philip.<a id="Anchor_1932" href="#Footnote_1932" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1932.">[1932]</a> Now, on the eleventh day after his wound—April
6, the Tuesday in Passion-week<a id="Anchor_1933" href="#Footnote_1933" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1933.">[1933]</a>—he made his confession
to one of his chaplains, and received the Holy Communion.
His soul being thus at peace, he gave directions for the disposal
of his body. It was to be embalmed; the brain and
some of the internal organs were to be buried in the ancient
Poitevin abbey of Charroux; the heart was to be deposited
in the Norman capital, where it had always found a loyal
response; the corpse itself was to be laid, in token of penitence,
at his father’s feet in the abbey-church of Fontevraud.<a id="Anchor_1934" href="#Footnote_1934" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1934.">[1934]</a>
Lastly, he received extreme unction; and then, “as the day
drew to its close, his day of life also came to its end.”<a id="Anchor_1935" href="#Footnote_1935" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1935.">[1935]</a>
His friends buried him as he had wished. <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Hugh of Lincoln,
now at Angers on his way to protest against a fresh
spoliation of his episcopal property, came to seal his forgiveness
by performing the last rites of the Church over this
second grave at Fontevraud,<a id="Anchor_1936" href="#Footnote_1936" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1936.">[1936]</a> where another Angevin king
was thus “shrouded among the shrouded women”—his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">ii.387</a></span>
mother, doubtless, in their midst.<a id="Anchor_1937" href="#Footnote_1937" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1937.">[1937]</a> He was laid to sleep in
the robes which he had worn on his last crowning-day in
England, five years before.<a id="Anchor_1938" href="#Footnote_1938" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1938.">[1938]</a> His heart was enclosed in a
gold and silver casket, carried to Rouen, and solemnly deposited
by the clergy among the holy relics in their cathedral
church;<a id="Anchor_1939" href="#Footnote_1939" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1939.">[1939]</a> and men saw in its unusual size<a id="Anchor_1940" href="#Footnote_1940" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1940.">[1940]</a> a fit token of
the mighty spirit of him whom Normandy never ceased to
venerate as Richard Cœur-de-Lion.</p>

<span class="ch2">THE FALL OF THE ANGEVINS.</span><br />

<span class="ch3">1199–1206.</span></h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1199,” says a contemporary French writer,
“God visited the realm of France; for King Richard was
slain.”<a id="Anchor_1941" href="#Footnote_1941" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1941.">[1941]</a> Richard’s death was in truth the signal for the
break-up of the Angevin dominions to the profit of the
French Crown. John, who was at the moment in Britanny,
hurried southward as soon as he heard the news. Three
days after the funeral—on April 14, the Wednesday before
Easter—he arrived at Chinon, the seat of the Angevin
treasury; the wardens of the castle<a id="Anchor_1942" href="#Footnote_1942" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1942.">[1942]</a> welcomed him as their
lord in his brother’s stead; the household of the late king
came to meet him and acknowledged him in like manner,
after receiving from him a solemn oath that he would carry
out Richard’s testamentary directions and maintain the
customs of the lands over which he was called to rule.<a id="Anchor_1943" href="#Footnote_1943" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1943.">[1943]</a> On
this understanding the treasury was given up to him by the
Angevin seneschal, Robert of Turnham.<a id="Anchor_1944" href="#Footnote_1944" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1944.">[1944]</a> After keeping
Easter at Beaufort,<a id="Anchor_1945" href="#Footnote_1945" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1945.">[1945]</a> he proceeded into Normandy; here he
was received without opposition, and on the Sunday after
Easter was invested with the sword, lance and coronet of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389">ii.389</a></span>
the duchy by Archbishop Walter at Rouen.<a id="Anchor_1946" href="#Footnote_1946" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1946.">[1946]</a> As the lance
was put into his hands he turned with characteristic levity to
join in the laughing comments of the young courtiers behind
him, and in so doing let the symbol of his ducal authority
fall to the ground. His irreverent behaviour and refusal to
communicate on Easter-day had already drawn upon him a
solemn warning from <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Hugh; and this fresh example of
his profane recklessness, and its consequence, were noted as
omens which later events made but too easy of interpretation.<a id="Anchor_1947" href="#Footnote_1947" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1947.">[1947]</a>
For the moment, however, the Normans were willing to
transfer to Richard’s chosen successor the loyalty which they
had shewn towards Richard himself; and so, too, were the
representatives of the English Church and baronage who
happened to be on the spot, Archbishop Hubert and William
the Marshal.<a id="Anchor_1948" href="#Footnote_1948" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1948.">[1948]</a> But in the Angevin lands Philip’s alliance
with the Bretons, fruitless so long as Richard lived, bore
fruit as soon as the lion-heart had ceased to beat. While
Philip himself invaded the county of Evreux and took its
capital,<a id="Anchor_1949" href="#Footnote_1949" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1949.">[1949]</a> Arthur was at once sent into Anjou with a body of
troops;<a id="Anchor_1950" href="#Footnote_1950" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1950.">[1950]</a> his mother, released or escaped from her prison,
joined him at the head of the Breton forces;<a id="Anchor_1951" href="#Footnote_1951" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1951.">[1951]</a> they marched
upon Le Mans, whence John himself only escaped the night
before it fell into their hands;<a id="Anchor_1952" href="#Footnote_1952" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1952.">[1952]</a> Angers was given up to them
by its governor, a nephew of the seneschal Robert of Turnham;<a id="Anchor_1953" href="#Footnote_1953" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1953.">[1953]</a>
and on Easter-day,<a id="Anchor_1954" href="#Footnote_1954" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1954.">[1954]</a> while John was actually holding
court within fifteen miles of them at Beaufort, the barons of
Anjou, Touraine and Maine held a council at which Arthur
was unanimously acknowledged as lawful heir to his uncle
Richard according to the customs of the three counties, and
their capital cities were surrendered to him at once.<a id="Anchor_1955" href="#Footnote_1955" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1955.">[1955]</a> At Le<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390">ii.390</a></span>
Mans he met the French king and did homage to him for
his new dominions, Constance swearing fealty with him.<a id="Anchor_1956" href="#Footnote_1956" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1956.">[1956]</a>
Shortly afterwards, at Tours, Constance formally placed her
boy, who was now twelve years old, under the guardianship
of Philip; and Philip at once took upon himself the
custody and the administration of all the territories of his
ward.<a id="Anchor_1957" href="#Footnote_1957" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1957.">[1957]</a></p>

<p>Neither in personal influence nor in political skill, however,
was Constance a match for her mother-in-law. Eleanor
was, as has been seen, at Fontevraud when Richard died.
Feeling and policy alike inclined her to favour the cause of
his chosen successor, her own only surviving son, rather than
that of a grandson whom most likely she had never even
seen. She therefore effected a junction with Mercadier and
his Brabantines as soon as they had had time to march up from
Châlus, and the whole band of mercenaries, headed by the
aged queen and the ruthless but faithful Provençal captain,
overran Anjou with fire and sword to punish its inhabitants
for their abandonment of John.<a id="Anchor_1958" href="#Footnote_1958" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1958.">[1958]</a> Having given this proof of
her undiminished energy, Eleanor, to take away all pretext
for French intermeddling in the south, went to meet Philip
at Tours and herself did homage to him for Poitou.<a id="Anchor_1959" href="#Footnote_1959" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1959.">[1959]</a> By this
means Aquitaine was secured for John. John himself had
made a dash into Maine and burned Le Mans in vengeance
for the defection of its citizens.<a id="Anchor_1960" href="#Footnote_1960" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1960.">[1960]</a> He could, however, venture
upon no serious attempt at the reconquest of the Angevin
lands till he had secured his hold upon Normandy and
England; and for this his presence was now urgently needed
on the English side of the Channel.</p>

<p>Archbishop Hubert and William the Marshal had already
returned to England charged with a commission from John
to assist the justiciar Geoffrey Fitz-Peter in maintaining
order there until the new king should arrive.<a id="Anchor_1961" href="#Footnote_1961" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1961.">[1961]</a> The precaution
was far from being a needless one. The news of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391">ii.391</a></span>
Richard’s death reached England on Easter Eve; and its
consequences appeared the very next morning, when some
of the nobles and knights went straight from their Easter
feast to begin a course of rapine and depredation which
recalls the disorders after the death of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, and which
was only checked by the return of the primate. Hubert at
once excommunicated the evil-doers,<a id="Anchor_1962" href="#Footnote_1962" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1962.">[1962]</a> and, in concert with
the Marshal, summoned all the men of the realm to swear
fealty and peaceable submission to John, as heir of Henry
Fitz-Empress. The peace, however, was not so easy to keep
now as it had been during the interval between Henry’s death
and Richard’s coronation. Since then John himself had set
an example which those whom he now claimed as his subjects
were not slow to follow. All who had castles, whether
bishops, earls or barons, furnished them with men, victuals
and arms, and assumed an attitude of defence, if not of
defiance; and this attitude they quitted only when the
archbishop, the marshal and the justiciar had called all the
malcontents to a conference at Northampton, and there
solemnly promised that John should render to all men their
rights, if they would keep faith and peace towards him. On
this the barons took the oath of fealty and liege homage to
John. The king of Scots refused to do the like unless his
lost counties of Northumberland and Cumberland were
restored to him, and despatched messengers charged with these
demands to John himself; the envoys were, however, intercepted
by the archbishop and his colleagues, and the Scot
king was for a while appeased by a promise of satisfaction
when the new sovereign should arrive in his island-realm.<a id="Anchor_1963" href="#Footnote_1963" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1963.">[1963]</a></p>

<p>On May 25 John landed at Shoreham; next day he
reached London;<a id="Anchor_1964" href="#Footnote_1964" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1964.">[1964]</a> on the 27th—Ascension-day—the bishops
and barons assembled for the crowning in Westminster abbey.<a id="Anchor_1965" href="#Footnote_1965" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1965.">[1965]</a>
John’s coronation is one of the most memorable in English
history. It was the last occasion on which the old English
doctrine of succession to the crown was formally asserted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392">ii.392</a></span>
and publicly vindicated, and that more distinctly than it had
ever been since the Norman conquest. In the midst of the
crowded church the archbishop stood forth and spoke:
“Hearken, all ye that are here present! Be it known unto
you that no man hath any antecedent right to succeed
another in the kingdom, except he be unanimously chosen
by the whole realm, after invocation of the Holy Spirit’s
grace, and unless he be also manifestly thereunto called by
the pre-eminence of his character and conversation, after the
pattern of Saul the first anointed king, whom God set over
his people, although he was not of royal race, and likewise
after him David, the one being chosen for his energy and
fitness for the regal dignity, the other for his humility and
holiness; that so he who surpassed all other men of the
realm in vigour should also be preferred before them in
authority and power. But indeed if there be one of the dead
king’s race who excelleth, that one should be the more
promptly and willingly chosen. And these things have I
spoken in behalf of the noble Count John here present, the
brother of our late illustrious King Richard, now deceased
without direct heir; and forasmuch as we see him to be
prudent and vigorous, we all, after invoking the Holy Spirit’s
grace, for his merits no less than his royal blood, have with
one consent chosen him for our king.” The archbishop’s
hearers wondered at his speech, because they could not see
any occasion for it; but none of them disputed his doctrine;
still less did they dispute its immediate practical application.
“Long live King John!” was the unanimous response;<a id="Anchor_1966" href="#Footnote_1966" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1966.">[1966]</a> and,
disregarding a protest from Bishop Philip of Durham against
the accomplishment of such an important rite in the absence
of his metropolitan Geoffrey of York,<a id="Anchor_1967" href="#Footnote_1967" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1967.">[1967]</a> Archbishop Hubert
proceeded to anoint and crown the king. A foreboding
which he could not put aside, however, moved him to make
yet another significant interpolation in the ritual. When he
tendered to the king-elect the usual oath for the defence of
the Church, the redressing of wrongs and the maintenance
of justice, he added a solemn personal adjuration to John, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393">ii.393</a></span>
Heaven’s name, warning him not to venture upon accepting
the regal office unless he truly purposed in his own mind to
perform his oath. John answered that by God’s help he
intended to do so.<a id="Anchor_1968" href="#Footnote_1968" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1968.">[1968]</a> But he contrived to omit the act which
should have sealed his vow. For the first and last time
probably in the history of Latin Christendom, the king did
not communicate upon his coronation-day.<a id="Anchor_1969" href="#Footnote_1969" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1969.">[1969]</a></p>

<p>On that very day he made his arrangements for the
government of the realm which he was already anxious to
leave as soon as he could do so with safety. Geoffrey Fitz-Peter
was confirmed in his office of justiciar, William in that
of marshal, and both were formally invested with the earldoms
whose lands and revenues they had already enjoyed
for some years—Geoffrey with the earldom of Essex,
William with that of Striguil. At the same time, in defiance
alike of precedent, of ecclesiastical propriety, and of the
warnings of an old colleague in the administration, Hugh
Bardulf, Archbishop Hubert undertook the office of chancellor.<a id="Anchor_1970" href="#Footnote_1970" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1970.">[1970]</a>
Next day John received the homage of the barons,
and went on pilgrimage to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Alban’s abbey;<a id="Anchor_1971" href="#Footnote_1971" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1971.">[1971]</a> he afterwards
visited Canterbury and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s,<a id="Anchor_1972" href="#Footnote_1972" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1972.">[1972]</a> and thence proceeded
to keep the Whitsun feast at Northampton.<a id="Anchor_1973" href="#Footnote_1973" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1973.">[1973]</a> An interchange
of embassies with the king of Scots failed to win
either the restitution of the two shires on the one hand, or
the required homage on the other; William threatened to
invade the disputed territories if they were not made over to
him within forty days; John retorted by giving them in
charge to a new sheriff, the brave and loyal William de
Stuteville, and by appointing new guardians to the temporalities
of York, as security for the defence of the north
against the Scots,<a id="Anchor_1974" href="#Footnote_1974" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1974.">[1974]</a> while he himself hurried back to the sea,

<p>On Midsummer-day he made a truce with Philip for
three weeks.<a id="Anchor_1976" href="#Footnote_1976" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1976.">[1976]</a> At its expiration the two kings held a
personal meeting; John’s occupation of his brother’s territories
without previous investiture from and homage to
Philip was complained of by the latter as an unpardonable
wrong; and John was required to expiate it by the cession
of the whole Vexin to Philip in absolute ownership, and of
Poitou and the three Angevin counties for the benefit of
Arthur. This John refused.<a id="Anchor_1977" href="#Footnote_1977" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1977.">[1977]</a> His fortunes were not yet so
desperate as to compel him to such humiliation. He had
already secured the alliance of Flanders;<a id="Anchor_1978" href="#Footnote_1978" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1978.">[1978]</a> his nephew Otto,
now fully acknowledged by the Pope as Emperor-elect, was
urging him to war with France and promising him the aid
of the imperial forces;<a id="Anchor_1979" href="#Footnote_1979" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1979.">[1979]</a> and his refusal of submission to
Philip was at once followed by offers of homage and mutual
alliance from all those French feudataries who had been in
league with Richard against their own sovereign.<a id="Anchor_1980" href="#Footnote_1980" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1980.">[1980]</a> The war
began in September, with the taking of Conches by the
French king; this was followed by the capture of Ballon.
Philip, however, chose to celebrate these first successes by
levelling Ballon to the ground. As the castle stood upon
Cenomannian soil, it ought, according to the theory proclaimed
by Philip himself, to have been handed over by
him to Arthur; Arthur’s seneschal William des Roches
therefore remonstrated against its demolition as an injury
done to his young lord. Philip retorted that “he would
not for Arthur’s sake stay from dealing as he pleased with
his own acquisitions.” The consequence was a momentary
desertion of all his Breton allies. William des Roches not
only surrendered to John the city of Le Mans, which
Philip and Arthur had intrusted to him as governor, but
contrived to get the boy-duke of Britanny out of Philip’s
custody and bring him to his uncle, who received him into
seeming favour and peace.<a id="Anchor_1981" href="#Footnote_1981" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1981.">[1981]</a> That very day, however, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395">ii.395</a></span>
warning reached Arthur of the fate to which he was already
doomed by John; and on the following night he fled away
to Angers with his mother and a number of their friends.
Among the latter was the viscount Almeric of Thouars, who
had just been compelled to resign into John’s hands the
office of seneschal of Anjou and the custody of the fortress
of Chinon, which he held in Arthur’s name; and it seems
to have been shortly afterwards that Constance, apparently
casting off Ralf of Chester without even an attempt at
divorce, went through a ceremony of marriage with Almeric’s
brother Guy.<a id="Anchor_1982" href="#Footnote_1982" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1982.">[1982]</a></p>

October to last till <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Hilary’s day.<a id="Anchor_1983" href="#Footnote_1983" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1983.">[1983]</a> Its author was that
Cardinal Peter of Capua<a id="Anchor_1984" href="#Footnote_1984" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1984.">[1984]</a> who had negotiated the last truce
between Philip and Richard, and who now found another
occupation in punishing the matrimonial sins of the French
king<span class="nobreak">:—</span>Philip having sent away his queen Ingebiorg of
Denmark immediately after his marriage with her in 1193,
and three years later taken as his wife another princess,
Agnes of Merania.<a id="Anchor_1985" href="#Footnote_1985" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1985.">[1985]</a> At a Church council at Dijon on
December 6, 1199, the legate passed a sentence of interdict
upon the whole royal domain, to be publicly proclaimed on
the twentieth day after Christmas<a id="Anchor_1986" href="#Footnote_1986" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1986.">[1986]</a>—the very day on which
Philip’s truce with John would expire. It was no doubt
the prospect of this new trouble which moved Philip, when
he met John in conference between Gaillon and Les
Andelys,<a id="Anchor_1987" href="#Footnote_1987" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1987.">[1987]</a> to accept terms far more favourable to the English
king than those which he had offered six months before.
As a pledge of future peace and amity between the two
kings, Philip’s son Louis was to marry John’s niece Blanche,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396">ii.396</a></span>
a daughter of his sister Eleanor and her husband King
Alfonso of Castille; John was to bestow upon the bride, by
way of dowry, the city and county of Evreux and all those
Norman castles which had been in Philip’s possession on the
day of Richard’s death; he was also to give Philip thirty
thousand marks of silver, and to swear that he would give
no help to Otto for the vindication of his claim to the
Empire. The formal execution of the treaty was deferred
till the octave of midsummer; and while the aged queen-mother
Eleanor went to fetch her granddaughter from
Spain, John at the end of February took advantage of the
respite to make a hurried visit to England,<a id="Anchor_1988" href="#Footnote_1988" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1988.">[1988]</a> for the purpose
of raising the thirty thousand marks which he had promised
to Philip. This was done by means of a carucage or aid
of three shillings on every ploughland.<a id="Anchor_1989" href="#Footnote_1989" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1989.">[1989]</a> As a scutage of a
most unusual amount—two marks on the knight’s fee—had
already been levied since John’s accession, this new
impost was a sore burthen upon the country. The abbots
of some of the great Cistercian houses in Yorkshire withstood
it as an unheard-of infringement of their rights, to
which they could not assent without the permission of a
general chapter of their order. John in a fury bade the
sheriffs put all the White Monks outside the protection of
the law. The remonstrances of the primate compelled him
to revoke this command; but he rejected all offers of compromise
on the part of the monks, and “breathing out
threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the
Lord” went over sea again at the end of April.<a id="Anchor_1990" href="#Footnote_1990" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1990.">[1990]</a> As
France had been suffering the miseries of an interdict ever
since January,<a id="Anchor_1991" href="#Footnote_1991" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1991.">[1991]</a> Philip was now growing eager for peace.
He therefore met John at Gouleton, between Vernon and
Les Andelys, on May 22, and there a treaty was signed.
Its solid advantages were wholly on the side of John. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397">ii.397</a></span>
addition to the concessions made in January, he did indeed
resign in favour of Blanche and her bridegroom his claims
upon the fiefs of Berry; but the thirty thousand marks due
to Philip were reduced to twenty thousand; Arthur was
acknowledged as owing homage to his uncle for Britanny;
and John was formally recognized by the French king as
rightful heir to all the dominions of his father and his elder
brother.<a id="Anchor_1992" href="#Footnote_1992" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1992.">[1992]</a> On the morrow Louis and Blanche were married,
by the archbishop of Bordeaux, and on Norman soil, in consequence
of the interdict in France;<a id="Anchor_1993" href="#Footnote_1993" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1993.">[1993]</a> and on the same day,
at Vernon, John received in Philip’s presence Arthur’s homage
for Britanny,<a id="Anchor_1994" href="#Footnote_1994" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1994.">[1994]</a> Philip having already accepted that of
John for the whole continental dominions of the house of
Anjou.<a id="Anchor_1995" href="#Footnote_1995" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1995.">[1995]</a></p>

<p>The next six weeks were spent by John in a triumphant
progress southward, through Le Mans, Angers, Chinon,
Tours and Loches, into Aquitaine, where he remained until
the end of August.<a id="Anchor_1996" href="#Footnote_1996" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1996.">[1996]</a> While there, he received the homage
of his brother-in-law Count Raymond of Toulouse for the
dower-lands of Jane,<a id="Anchor_1997" href="#Footnote_1997" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1997.">[1997]</a> who had died in the preceding autumn.<a id="Anchor_1998" href="#Footnote_1998" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1998.">[1998]</a>
Of all these successes, however, John went far to cast away
the fruit by a desecration of the marriage-bond almost as
shameless and quite as impolitic as that which had brought
upon Philip the wrath of Rome. He persuaded the Aquitanian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398">ii.398</a></span>
and Norman bishops to annul his marriage with his
cousin Avice of Gloucester, apparently by making them
believe that the dispensation granted by Clement <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> had
been revoked by Innocent.<a id="Anchor_1999" href="#Footnote_1999" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1999.">[1999]</a> Instead however of restoring
to Avice the vast heritage which had been settled upon her
at her betrothal, he gave her county of Gloucester to her
sister’s husband Count Almeric of Evreux as compensation
for the loss of his Norman honour,<a id="Anchor_2000" href="#Footnote_2000" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2000.">[2000]</a> and apparently kept the
remainder of her estates in his own hands. These proceedings
were enough to excite the ill-will of a powerful section
of the English baronage. John’s next step was a direct
challenge to the most active, turbulent and troublesome
house in all Aquitaine. He gave out that he desired to
wed a daughter of the king of Portugal, and despatched an
honourable company of ambassadors, headed by the bishop
of Lisieux, to sue for her hand; after these envoys had
started, however, and without a word of notice to them, he
suddenly married the daughter of Count Ademar of Angoulême.<a id="Anchor_2001" href="#Footnote_2001" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2001.">[2001]</a>
Twenty-nine years before, Richard, as duke of
Aquitaine, had vainly striven to wrest Angoulême from
Ademar in behalf of Matilda, the only child of Ademar’s
brother Count Vulgrin <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> Matilda was now the wife of
Hugh “the Brown” of Lusignan, who in 1179 or 1180
had in spite of King Henry made himself master of La
Marche,<a id="Anchor_2002" href="#Footnote_2002" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2002.">[2002]</a> and whose personal importance in southern Gaul
was increased by the rank and fame which his brothers
Geoffrey, Guy and Almeric had won in the kingdoms of
Palestine and Cyprus. His son by Matilda—another Hugh
the Brown—had through Richard’s good offices been betrothed
in boyhood to his infant cousin Isabel, Ademar’s
only child; the little girl was educated with her future husband,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399">ii.399</a></span>
and it was hoped that in due time their marriage
would heal the family feud and unite the lands of Angoulême
and La Marche without possibility of further dissension.
No sooner however did Count Ademar discover
that a king wished to marry his daughter than he took her
away from her bridegroom; and at the end of August she
was married to John at Angoulême by the archbishop of
Bordeaux.<a id="Anchor_2003" href="#Footnote_2003" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2003.">[2003]</a></p>

<p>Heedless of the storm which this marriage was sure to
raise in Aquitaine, John in the first days of October carried
his child-queen with him to England, and on the 8th was
crowned with her at Westminster.<a id="Anchor_2004" href="#Footnote_2004" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2004.">[2004]</a> His first business in
England was to renew his persecution of the Cistercians;<a id="Anchor_2005" href="#Footnote_2005" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2005.">[2005]</a>
the next was to arrange a meeting with the king of Scots.
This took place in November at Lincoln, where John, defying
the tradition which his father had carefully observed,
ventured to present himself in regal state within the cathedral
church.<a id="Anchor_2006" href="#Footnote_2006" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2006.">[2006]</a> The two kings held their colloquy on a hill
outside the city; William performed his long-deferred homage,<a id="Anchor_2007" href="#Footnote_2007" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2007.">[2007]</a>
although his renewed demand for the restitution of
the northern shires was again put off till Whitsuntide.<a id="Anchor_2008" href="#Footnote_2008" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2008.">[2008]</a>
Next day the king of England helped with his own hands
to carry the body of the holy bishop Hugh to its last resting-place
in the minster which he had himself rebuilt.<a id="Anchor_2009" href="#Footnote_2009" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2009.">[2009]</a>
Some haunting remembrance of Hugh’s saintlike face, as
he had seen it in London only a few weeks before the good
bishop’s death,<a id="Anchor_2010" href="#Footnote_2010" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2010.">[2010]</a> may have combined with a sense that the
White Monks were still too great a power in the land to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400">ii.400</a></span>
defied with impunity, and moved John on the following
Sunday to make full amends to the Cistercian abbots, promising
to seal his repentance by founding a house of their
order<a id="Anchor_2011" href="#Footnote_2011" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2011.">[2011]</a>—a promise which he redeemed by the foundation of
Beaulieu abbey, in the New Forest.<a id="Anchor_2012" href="#Footnote_2012" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2012.">[2012]</a> After keeping Christmas
at Guildford<a id="Anchor_2013" href="#Footnote_2013" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2013.">[2013]</a> he came back again to Lincoln, and
quarrelled with the canons about the election of a new
bishop.<a id="Anchor_2014" href="#Footnote_2014" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2014.">[2014]</a> He thence went northward, accompanied by his
queen, through Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Northumberland and
Cumberland, taking fines everywhere for offences against the
forest-law. At Mid-Lent he was at York,<a id="Anchor_2015" href="#Footnote_2015" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2015.">[2015]</a> and on Easter-day
he and Isabel wore their crowns at Canterbury.<a id="Anchor_2016" href="#Footnote_2016" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2016.">[2016]</a> A
few days later, rumours of disturbances in Normandy and in
Poitou paused him to issue orders for the earls and barons
of England to meet him at Portsmouth at Whitsuntide,
ready with horses and ships to accompany him over sea.
The earls however held a meeting at Leicester, and thence
by common consent made answer to the king that they
would not go with him “unless he gave them back their
rights.” It is clear that they already looked upon personal
service beyond sea as no longer binding upon them without
their own consent, specially given for a special occasion.
John retorted by demanding the surrender of their castles,
beginning with William of Aubigny’s castle of Beauvoir,
which William was only suffered to retain on giving his son
as a hostage.<a id="Anchor_2017" href="#Footnote_2017" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2017.">[2017]</a> This threat brought the barons to Portsmouth
on the appointed day; but the quarrel ended in a
compromise. After despatching his chamberlain Hubert de
Burgh, with a hundred knights, to act as keeper of the
Welsh marches, and sending William the Marshal and Roger

<p>After a friendly meeting near the Isle of Andelys,<a id="Anchor_2020" href="#Footnote_2020" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2020.">[2020]</a> Philip
invited John to Paris, where he entertained him with the
highest honours, vacating his own palace for the reception
of his guest, and loading him with costly gifts.<a id="Anchor_2021" href="#Footnote_2021" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2021.">[2021]</a> From Paris
John went to meet his sister-in-law, Richard’s queen Berengaria,
at Chinon,<a id="Anchor_2022" href="#Footnote_2022" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2022.">[2022]</a> where he seems to have chiefly spent the
rest of the summer. He came back to Normandy in the
autumn,<a id="Anchor_2023" href="#Footnote_2023" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2023.">[2023]</a> and the Christmas feast at Argentan<a id="Anchor_2024" href="#Footnote_2024" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2024.">[2024]</a> passed over
in peace; but trouble was fast gathering on all sides.
Philip was at last free of his ecclesiastical difficulties, for
Agnes of Merania was dead, and he had taken back his
wife.<a id="Anchor_2025" href="#Footnote_2025" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2025.">[2025]</a> John was now in his turn to pay the penalty for his
unwarrantable divorce and his lawless second marriage. As
if he had not already done enough to alienate the powerful
house of Lusignan by stealing the plighted bride of its
head,<a id="Anchor_2026" href="#Footnote_2026" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2026.">[2026]</a> he had now seized the castle of Driencourt, which
belonged to a brother of Hugh the Brown, while its owner
was absent in England on business for the king himself;<a id="Anchor_2027" href="#Footnote_2027" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2027.">[2027]</a>
and he had further insulted the barons of Poitou by summoning
them to clear themselves in his court from a general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402">ii.402</a></span>
charge of treason against his late brother and himself, by
ordeal of battle with picked champions from England and
Normandy. They scorned the summons,<a id="Anchor_2028" href="#Footnote_2028" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2028.">[2028]</a> and appealed to
the king of France, John’s overlord as well as theirs, to
bring John to justice for their wrongs.<a id="Anchor_2029" href="#Footnote_2029" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2029.">[2029]</a> On March 25
Philip met John at Gouleton,<a id="Anchor_2030" href="#Footnote_2030" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2030.">[2030]</a> and peremptorily bade him
give up to Arthur all his French fiefs, besides sundry other
things, all of which John refused.<a id="Anchor_2031" href="#Footnote_2031" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2031.">[2031]</a> Hereupon Philip sent,
through some of the great French nobles,<a id="Anchor_2032" href="#Footnote_2032" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2032.">[2032]</a> a citation to
John, as duke of Aquitaine, to appear in Paris fifteen days
after Easter at the court of his lord the king of France, to
stand to its judgement, to answer to his lord for his misdoings,
and to undergo the sentence of his peers.<a id="Anchor_2033" href="#Footnote_2033" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2033.">[2033]</a> John
made no attempt to deny Philip’s jurisdiction; but he
declared that, as duke of Normandy, he was not bound to
obey the French king’s citation to any spot other than the
traditional trysting-place on the border. Philip replied that
his summons was addressed to the duke of Aquitaine, not
to the duke of Normandy, and that his rights over the
former were not to be annulled by the accidental union of
the two dignities in one person.<a id="Anchor_2034" href="#Footnote_2034" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2034.">[2034]</a> John at length yielded so
far as to promise that on the appointed day he would present
himself before the court in Paris, and would give up to
Philip the two castles of Tillières and Boutavant as security
for his abiding by the settlement then to be made. The
day however came and went without either the surrender of
the forts or the appearance of John.<a id="Anchor_2035" href="#Footnote_2035" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2035.">[2035]</a> The court of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403">ii.403</a></span>
French peers condemned him by default, and sentenced him
to be deprived of all his lands.<a id="Anchor_2036" href="#Footnote_2036" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2036.">[2036]</a></p>

<p>Philip at once marched upon Normandy to execute the
sentence by force of arms. He began by taking Boutavant<a id="Anchor_2037" href="#Footnote_2037" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2037.">[2037]</a>
and Tillières;<a id="Anchor_2038" href="#Footnote_2038" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2038.">[2038]</a> thence he marched straight up northward by
Lions,<a id="Anchor_2039" href="#Footnote_2039" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2039.">[2039]</a> Longchamp, La Ferté-en-Bray,<a id="Anchor_2040" href="#Footnote_2040" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2040.">[2040]</a> Orgueil and Mortemer,<a id="Anchor_2041" href="#Footnote_2041" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2041.">[2041]</a>
to Eu;<a id="Anchor_2042" href="#Footnote_2042" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2042.">[2042]</a> all these places fell into his hands. Thus
master of almost the whole Norman border from the Seine
to the sea, he turned back to lay siege on July 8 to Radepont
on the Andelle, scarcely more than ten miles from
Rouen. Dislodged at the end of a week by John,<a id="Anchor_2043" href="#Footnote_2043" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2043.">[2043]</a> he again
withdrew to the border. The castle of Aumale and the rest

alone, the worthy bearer of a name which for generations
had been almost a synonym for loyalty to the Norman
ducal house, still held out in his impregnable castle; Philip
however, by breaking down the embankment which kept in
the waters of a reservoir communicating with the river and
the moat, let loose upon the castle a flood which undermined
its walls and almost swept it away, thus compelling its
defenders to make their escape and take shelter as best
they could in the neighbouring forest.<a id="Anchor_2045" href="#Footnote_2045" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2045.">[2045]</a> At Gournay Philip

the honour of knighthood,<a id="Anchor_2047" href="#Footnote_2047" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2047.">[2047]</a> and the investiture of all the
Angevin dominions except the duchy of Normandy,<a id="Anchor_2048" href="#Footnote_2048" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2048.">[2048]</a> which
he evidently intended to conquer for himself and keep by

The order of the campaign above described is not easy to
make out, for no two contemporary writers name the castles in the same order.
Taking geography for a guide, it would at first glance seem more natural that
Philip should have gone to Radepont from Tillières, and that the whole northward
expedition should come afterwards. But it is certain that the siege of
Radepont happened July 8–15 (see above, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 403, note 8<a href="#Footnote_2043" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2043">{2043}</a>); and on the one hand,
the northern campaign, or at any rate part of it, seems needed to fill up the
interval between the breaking-out of the war at the beginning of May and July
8; while on the other, it seems impossible to crowd in the whole campaign
between July 15 and the knighting of Arthur, which clearly took place before
that month had expired. Lions, however, was not taken till after May 29, for
on that day John was there;

<p>What John had been doing all this time it is difficult to
understand. Between the middle of May and the end of
June he had shifted his quarters incessantly, moving through
the whole length of eastern Normandy, from Arques to Le
Mans; throughout July he was chiefly in the neighbourhood
of Rouen;<a id="Anchor_2049" href="#Footnote_2049" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2049.">[2049]</a> but, except in the one expedition to Radepont,
he seems to have made no attempt to check the progress of
his enemies. After the knighting of Arthur at Gournay,
however, he tried to make a diversion by sending a body
of troops into Britanny. With their duchess dead<a id="Anchor_2050" href="#Footnote_2050" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2050.">[2050]</a> and
their young duke absent, the Bretons were in no condition
for defence; Dol and Fougères were taken by John’s soldiers,
and the whole country ravaged as far as Rennes.<a id="Anchor_2051" href="#Footnote_2051" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2051.">[2051]</a> This
attack stung Arthur into an attempt at independent action
which led to his ruin. He and Philip divided their forces;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405">ii.405</a></span>
while the French king led the bulk of his army northward
to the siege of Arques,<a id="Anchor_2052" href="#Footnote_2052" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2052.">[2052]</a> Arthur with two hundred knights<a id="Anchor_2053" href="#Footnote_2053" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2053.">[2053]</a>
moved southward to Tours,<a id="Anchor_2054" href="#Footnote_2054" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2054.">[2054]</a> sending forward a summons to
the men of his own duchy and those of Berry to meet him
there for an expedition into Poitou.<a id="Anchor_2055" href="#Footnote_2055" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2055.">[2055]</a> At Tours he was met
by the disaffected Aquitanian chiefs<span class="nobreak">:—</span>the injured bridegroom
young Hugh of La Marche, and two of his uncles,
Ralf of Issoudun the dispossessed count of Eu, and Geoffrey
of Lusignan, the inveterate fighter who had taken a leading
part in every Aquitanian rising throughout the last twenty-two
years of Henry’s reign, who after being Richard’s bitterest
foe at home had been one of his best supporters in Palestine,
and who had come back, it seems, to join in one more fight
against his successor. The three kinsmen, however, brought
together a force of only seventy-five knights; to which a
Gascon baron, Savaric of Mauléon, added thirty more, and
seventy men-at-arms.<a id="Anchor_2056" href="#Footnote_2056" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2056.">[2056]</a> Arthur, mere boy of fifteen though
he was, had enough of the hereditary Angevin wariness to
shrink from attempting to act with such a small force, and
in accordance with Philip’s instructions proposed to wait for
his expected allies.<a id="Anchor_2057" href="#Footnote_2057" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2057.">[2057]</a> But the Poitevins would brook no
delay; and a temptation now offered itself which was irresistible
alike to them and to their young leader. On her
return from Castille with her granddaughter Blanche in the
spring of 1200, Queen Eleanor, worn out with age and
fatigue, had withdrawn to the abbey of Fontevraud,<a id="Anchor_2058" href="#Footnote_2058" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2058.">[2058]</a> where
she apparently remained throughout the next two years.
The rising troubles of her duchy, however, seem to have
brought her forth from her retirement once more, and she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406">ii.406</a></span>
was now in the castle of Mirebeau, on the border of Anjou
and Poitou. All John’s enemies knew that his mother
was, in every sense, his best friend. She was at once
his most devoted ally and his most sagacious counsellor,
at least in all continental affairs; moreover, in strict
feudal law, she was still duchess of Aquitaine in her
own right, a right untouched by the forfeiture of John;
and she therefore had it in her power to make that
forfeiture null and void south of the Loire, so long as
she lived to assert her claims for John’s benefit.<a id="Anchor_2059" href="#Footnote_2059" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2059.">[2059]</a> To
capture Eleanor would be to bring John to his knees;
and with this hope Arthur and his little band laid siege to
Mirebeau.<a id="Anchor_2060" href="#Footnote_2060" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2060.">[2060]</a></p>

<p>John, however, when once roused, could act with all the
vigour and promptitude of his race. On July 30, as he was
approaching Le Mans, he received tidings of his mother’s
danger; on August 1 he suddenly appeared before Mirebeau.<a id="Anchor_2061" href="#Footnote_2061" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2061.">[2061]</a>
The town was already lost, all the gates of the
castle save one were broken down, and Eleanor had been
driven to take refuge in the keep; the besiegers, thinking
their triumph assured, were surprised and overpowered by
John’s troops, and were slain or captured to a man, the
Lusignans and Arthur himself being among the prisoners.<a id="Anchor_2062" href="#Footnote_2062" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2062.">[2062]</a>
Philip, who was busy with the siege of Arques, left it and
hurried southward on hearing of this disaster;<a id="Anchor_2063" href="#Footnote_2063" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2063.">[2063]</a> John however
at once put an end to his hopes of rescuing Arthur by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407">ii.407</a></span>
sending the boy to prison at Falaise;<a id="Anchor_2064" href="#Footnote_2064" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2064.">[2064]</a> and Philip, after
taking and burning Tours,<a id="Anchor_2065" href="#Footnote_2065" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2065.">[2065]</a> withdrew into his own domains.<a id="Anchor_2066" href="#Footnote_2066" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2066.">[2066]</a>
John in his turn then marched upon Tours, and vented his
wrath at its capture by completing its destruction.<a id="Anchor_2067" href="#Footnote_2067" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2067.">[2067]</a> Shortly
afterwards he had the good luck to make prisoner another
disaffected Aquitanian noble, the viscount of Limoges.<a id="Anchor_2068" href="#Footnote_2068" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2068.">[2068]</a> It
was however growing evident that he would soon have
nothing but his own resources to depend upon. His allies
were falling away; the counts of Flanders, Blois and Perche
and several of the other malcontent French barons had taken
the cross and abandoned the field of western politics to seek
their fortunes in the East;<a id="Anchor_2069" href="#Footnote_2069" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2069.">[2069]</a> he had quarrelled with Otto of
Germany;<a id="Anchor_2070" href="#Footnote_2070" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2070.">[2070]</a> William des Roches, after pleading in vain for
Arthur’s release, was organizing a league of the Breton
nobles which some of the Norman border-chiefs were quite
ready to join, and by the end of October the party thus
formed was strong enough to seize Angers and establish its
head-quarters there.<a id="Anchor_2071" href="#Footnote_2071" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2071.">[2071]</a> It was probably the knowledge of all
this which in the beginning of 1203 made John transfer his
captive nephew from the castle of Falaise to that of Rouen.<a id="Anchor_2072" href="#Footnote_2072" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2072.">[2072]</a>
Sinister rumours of Arthur’s fate were already in circulation,
telling how John had sent a ruffian to blind him at Falaise,
how the soldiers who kept him had frustrated the design,
and how their commandant, John’s chamberlain Hubert de
Burgh, had endeavoured to satisfy the king by giving out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408">ii.408</a></span>
that Arthur had died of wounds and grief and ordering
funeral services in his memory, till the threats of the infuriated
Bretons drove him to confess the fraud for the sake of John’s
own safety.<a id="Anchor_2073" href="#Footnote_2073" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2073.">[2073]</a> How or when Arthur really died has never
yet been clearly proved. We only know that at Easter
1203 all France was ringing with the tidings of his death,
and that after that date he was never seen alive. In his
uncle’s interest an attempt was made to suggest that he
had either pined to death in his prison, or been drowned in
endeavouring to escape across the Seine;<a id="Anchor_2074" href="#Footnote_2074" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2074.">[2074]</a> but the general
belief, which John’s after-conduct tends strongly to confirm,
was that he had been stabbed and then flung into the river
by the orders, if not actually by the hands, of John himself.<a id="Anchor_2075" href="#Footnote_2075" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2075.">[2075]</a></p>

<p>The fire which had been smouldering throughout the
winter in Britanny now burst into a blaze. The barons and
prelates of the duchy, it is said, held a meeting at Vannes,
and thence sent to the king of France, as overlord alike of
Arthur and of John, their demand for a judicial inquisition
before the peers of the realm—that is, before the supreme
feudal court of France—into John’s dealings with their
captive duke.<a id="Anchor_2076" href="#Footnote_2076" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2076.">[2076]</a> A citation was accordingly sent to John, as
duke of Normandy, either to present Arthur alive,<a id="Anchor_2077" href="#Footnote_2077" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2077.">[2077]</a> or to come
and stand his trial before the French king’s court on a charge
of murder. John neither appeared nor sent any defence;
the court pronounced him worthy of death, and sentenced
him and his heirs to forfeiture of all the lands and honours
which he held of the Crown of France.<a id="Anchor_2078" href="#Footnote_2078" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2078.">[2078]</a> The trial seems to
have been held shortly after Easter. The legal force of the
sentence need not be discussed here.<a id="Anchor_2079" href="#Footnote_2079" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2079.">[2079]</a> Its moral justice can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409">ii.409</a></span>
hardly be disputed, so far as John himself is concerned; and
Philip’s action did little more than precipitate the consequences
which must sooner or later have naturally resulted
from John’s own deed. John in committing a great crime
had committed an almost greater blunder. Arthur’s death
left him indeed without a rival in his own house. It left him
sole survivor, in the male line, alike of the Angevin and
Cenomannian counts and of the ducal house of Normandy.
Even in the female line there was no one who could be set
up against him as representative of either race. Eleanor of
Britanny, the only remaining child of his brother Geoffrey,
was a prisoner in her uncle’s keeping. The sons of his
sister Matilda had cast in their lot with their father’s country
and severed all ties with their mother’s people; the children
of his sister Eleanor were still more complete strangers to
the political interests of northern Gaul, and the only one of
them who was known there at all was known only as the
wife of the heir to the French crown. But these very facts
set John face to face with a more dangerous rival than any
of the ambitious kinsmen with whom the two Williams or
the two Henrys had had to contend. They drove his disaffected
subjects to choose between submission to him and
submission to Philip Augustus. The barons of Anjou, of
Maine, of Britanny or of Normandy had no longer any
chance of freeing themselves from the yoke of the king
from over-sea who had become a stranger to them all alike,
save by accepting in its stead the yoke of the king with whom
they had grown familiar through years of political and personal
intercourse, and whom, in theory at least, even their own
rulers had always acknowledged as their superior. Anjou,
Maine and Britanny had all resolved upon Richard’s death
that they would not have John to rule over them; Normandy
was now fast coming to the same determination. Under the
existing circumstances it would cost them little or no sacrifice
to accept their titular overlord as their real and immediate
sovereign. So long as Arthur lived, Philip had been compelled
to veil his ambition under a shew of zeal for Arthur’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410">ii.410</a></span>
rights; now he could fling aside the veil, and present himself
almost in the character of a deliverer. If the barons did
not actually hail him as such, they were at any rate for the
most part not unwilling to leave to him the responsibility of
accomplishing their deliverance, and to accept it quietly from
his hands.</p>

<p>Philip took the field as soon as the forfeiture was proclaimed.
Within a fortnight after Easter he had taken
Saumur<a id="Anchor_2080" href="#Footnote_2080" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2080.">[2080]</a> and entered Aquitaine; there he seems to have
spent some weeks in taking sundry castles, with the help of
the Bretons and the malcontent Poitevin nobles.<a id="Anchor_2081" href="#Footnote_2081" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2081.">[2081]</a> One great
Norman baron, the viscount of Beaumont, had already openly
joined the league against John;<a id="Anchor_2082" href="#Footnote_2082" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2082.">[2082]</a> and as Philip turned northward
again, the count of Alençon formally placed himself
and all his lands at the disposal of the French king.<a id="Anchor_2083" href="#Footnote_2083" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2083.">[2083]</a> Thus
secure of a strong foothold on the southern frontier of
Normandy, and already by his last year’s conquests master
of its north-eastern border from Eu to Gisors, Philip set
himself to win the intervening territory—the remnant of the
viscounty of Evreux. One by one its castles—Conches,<a id="Anchor_2084" href="#Footnote_2084" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2084.">[2084]</a>
Vaudreuil<a id="Anchor_2085" href="#Footnote_2085" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2085.">[2085]</a> and many others—fell into his hands. Messenger
after messenger came to John as he sat idle in his palace at
Rouen,<a id="Anchor_2086" href="#Footnote_2086" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2086.">[2086]</a> all charged with the same story: “The king of
France is in your land as an enemy, he is taking
your castles, he is binding your seneschals to their horses’
tails and leading them shamefully to prison, and he is
dealing with your goods according to his own will and
pleasure.” “Let him alone,” John answered them all
alike; “I shall win back some day all that he is taking
from me now.” The barons who still clave to him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411">ii.411</a></span>
grew exasperated as they watched his unmoved face and
heard his unvarying reply; some of them began to attribute
his indifference to the effects of magic; all, finding it impossible
to break the spell, turned away from him in despair.
One by one they took their leave and withdrew to their
homes, either passively to await the end, or actively to join
Philip. Even Hugh of Gournay, who had held out so
bravely and so faithfully a year ago, now voluntarily gave up
his castle of Montfort.<a id="Anchor_2087" href="#Footnote_2087" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2087.">[2087]</a> Not till near the middle of August
did John make any warlike movement; then he suddenly
laid siege to Alençon; but at Philip’s approach he fled in a
panic;<a id="Anchor_2088" href="#Footnote_2088" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2088.">[2088]</a> an attempt to regain Brezolles ended in like manner,<a id="Anchor_2089" href="#Footnote_2089" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2089.">[2089]</a>
and John relapsed into his former inactivity. That the
conqueror did not march straight to the capture of Rouen,
that he in fact made no further progress towards it for six
whole months, was owing not to John but to his predecessor.
Richard’s favourite capital was safe, so long as it was sheltered
behind the group of fortifications crowned by his “saucy
castle” on the Rock of Andely.</p>

John was not literally there all the while; but he only quitted it for short
excursions, never going further than Moulineaux, Pont-de-l’Arche, Orival or
Montfort, from the middle of May till the beginning of August, when he suddenly
went as far west as Caen, and thence as suddenly south again to Falaise and
Alençon.

<p>Upon the winning of Château-Gaillard, therefore, Philip
now concentrated all his energies and all his skill. There
was no hope of voluntary surrender here; John had given
the fortress in charge to Roger de Lacy the constable of
Chester, an English baron who had no stake in Normandy,
whose private interests were therefore bound up with those of
the English king, and who was moreover a man of dauntless
courage and high military capacity.<a id="Anchor_2090" href="#Footnote_2090" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2090.">[2090]</a> The place was only to
be won by a regular siege. Crossing the Seine higher up,
perhaps at Vernon, Philip led his troops along its left bank,
and encamped in the peninsula formed by the bend of the
river just opposite Les Andelys. The garrison of the fort in
the Isle of Andely no sooner beheld his approach than they
destroyed the bridge between the island and the left bank.
Philip was thus deprived of the means not only of reaching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412">ii.412</a></span>
them, but also of opening communications with the opposite
shore; for this could only be done with safety at some point
below Château-Gaillard, and the transport of the materials
needful for the construction of a bridge or pontoon was
barred by the stockade which crossed the river-bed directly
under the foot of the castle-rock. The daring of a few young
Frenchmen, however, soon cleared this obstacle away. While
the king brought up his engines close to the water’s edge
and kept the garrison of the island-fort occupied with the
exchange of a constant fire of missiles, a youth named
Gaubert of Mantes with a few bold comrades plunged into
the water, each with an axe in his hand, and, regardless of
the stones and arrows which kept falling upon them from
both sides, hewed at the stockade till they had made a breach
wide enough for boats to pass through in safety. A number
of the broad flat-bottomed barges used for transport were
then hastily collected from the neighbouring riverside towns,
and moored side by side across the stream; these served as
the foundation of a wooden bridge, which was further supported
with stakes and strengthened with towers, and by
means of which Philip himself, with the larger part of his
host, crossed the river to form a new encampment under the
walls of the Lesser Andely. The garrison of the Isle were
thus placed between two fires;<a id="Anchor_2091" href="#Footnote_2091" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2091.">[2091]</a> and the whole Vexin was
laid open as a foraging-ground for the besieging army, while
the occupants of the Lesser Andely and of Château-Gaillard
itself found their communications and their supplies cut off on
all sides.<a id="Anchor_2092" href="#Footnote_2092" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2092.">[2092]</a></p>

<p>John was now again hovering about at a safe distance
in the neighbourhood.<a id="Anchor_2093" href="#Footnote_2093" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2093.">[2093]</a> To the peril of Château-Gaillard
his fatuous indifference was at last beginning to yield. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413">ii.413</a></span>
year ago he had shewn some appreciation of his brother’s
work, by making an addition to the buildings in the second
ward;<a id="Anchor_2094" href="#Footnote_2094" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2094.">[2094]</a> and he had shewn his sense of the military importance
of the place yet more significantly, by appointing
Roger de Lacy as its commander. He now gathered up
all his remaining forces—still, it seems, a formidable array<a id="Anchor_2095" href="#Footnote_2095" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2095.">[2095]</a>—with
the apparent intention of dislodging the French
from Les Andelys. As Philip’s biographer remarks, however,
John feared and hated the light; he resolved, according
to his wont, upon a night attack; and even that attack
he did not lead in person.<a id="Anchor_2096" href="#Footnote_2096" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2096.">[2096]</a> He intrusted its command
indeed to a far braver man than himself, but a man who
was better fitted for action in the light of day than for such
deeds of darkness as John delighted in. William the
Marshal, the favourite comrade-in-arms of the younger King
Henry, the faithful friend and servant of the elder one even
unto death, the honoured minister of Richard, still clave to
the last survivor of the house which he had loved so long
and so well. To him John confided his plan for the relief
of Les Andelys. The marshal was to lead a force of three
hundred knights, three thousand mounted serving-men and
four thousand foot, with a band of mercenaries under a chief
called Lupicar,<a id="Anchor_2097" href="#Footnote_2097" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2097.">[2097]</a> along the left bank of the Seine, and to fall
under cover of darkness upon the French camp in the
peninsula. Meanwhile seventy transport-vessels, constructed
by Richard to serve either for sea or river-traffic, and as
many more as could be collected, were to be laden with

their own daring and reckless crews, a force of three thousand
Flemings. Two hundred strokes of the oar, John reckoned,
would bring these ships to the French pontoon; they must
break it if they could; if not, they could at least co-operate
with the land-forces under the Marshal in cutting off the
northern division of the French army from its comrades and
supplies on the left bank, and throw into the island-fort
provisions enough to save it from the necessity of surrender
till John himself should come to its relief.</p>

It seems a strange return to long-past times to hear of “<em>pirates</em>” sailing up
the Seine to attack a king of the French. Of what nationality are these men
likely to have been?
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The flower of the French host, as John knew, had
crossed the river with its king. Those who remained in
the peninsula were hampered by the presence of a crowd of
unwarlike serving-men, sutlers and camp-followers, many of
whom, after spending the day in drunken revelry, were lying
asleep in the fields outside the camp. The night was
drawing to its close—for the cock had crowed thrice—when
the Marshal’s troops fell upon these sleepers and slew more
than two hundred of them as they lay. The soldiers within
the camp quickly caught the alarm; in their terror they
rushed to the pontoon in such numbers that it broke under
their weight, and they sought safety in swimming across the
river to join their comrades on the opposite shore. These
however had now been aroused by the tumult; the bravest
of the French knights, headed by William des Barres, confronted
the fugitives with indignant reproaches for their
cowardice, and drove them back across the stream. By the
light of torches and fires, hastily kindled, the whole host was
soon got under arms, the bridge repaired, and the Marshal’s
troops, surprised in their turn while groping about in the
darkness of the deserted camp, were routed with heavy loss.
The victors, thinking the fight was over, went back to their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415">ii.415</a></span>
sleeping-quarters, but had scarcely reached them when they
were roused up again, to see, in the dim light of the August
sunrise, the hostile fleet bearing down upon them. In a few
minutes the two river-banks and the pontoon were lined
with armed Frenchmen. Still the boats held on their
course till the foremost of them touched the bridge; and
despite a ceaseless shower of arrows from either shore, and
of stones, iron missiles, and boiling oil and pitch from the
engines mounted on the wooden turrets of the bridge, the
crews began to hew at the cables and stakes in a desperate
effort to break it down, and kept its defenders at bay till the
Seine ran red with blood. At last an enormously heavy
oaken beam fell directly upon the two foremost ships and
sank them. The rest, stricken with sudden terror, rowed
away in disorder as fast as oars could move them. Gaubert
of Mantes and three other gallant French sailors sprang
each into a little boat, set off in pursuit, and succeeded in
capturing two of the fugitive ships, which they brought back
in tow, with their stores and all of their crews who survived.<a id="Anchor_2099" href="#Footnote_2099" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2099.">[2099]</a>
The delay in the arrival of the fleet, caused by the difficulties
of navigation in the Seine,<a id="Anchor_2100" href="#Footnote_2100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2100.">[2100]</a> had ruined John’s plan for the
relief of the Isle of Andely. The fate of its garrison was
soon decided; and again the hero of the day was Gaubert
of Mantes. The fort was encircled by a double palisade or
rampart of wood, outside the walls. Gaubert tied a rope
round his waist, took in his hand two iron vessels coated
with pitch and filled with burning charcoal,<a id="Anchor_2101" href="#Footnote_2101" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2101.">[2101]</a> swam to the
easternmost point of the island, which the garrison, trusting
to the proximity of Château-Gaillard on this side, had
ventured to leave unguarded, and threw these missiles
against the palisade. The wood instantly caught fire; the
wind carried the flames all round the ramparts and into the
fort itself. Some of the garrison made their escape by
swimming or on rafts; some were stifled in the cellars and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416">ii.416</a></span>
galleries in which they sought a refuge from the fire; the
rest surrendered to the French king. Philip lost no time
in repairing and garrisoning the fort and rebuilding the
bridge on its western side. At the sight of his success the
whole population of the Lesser Andely fled in a body to
Château-Gaillard; Philip entered the town in triumph, sent
for new inhabitants to fill the places of the fugitives, and intrusted
its defence to two companies of mercenaries, whose
strength may be estimated from the statement that the
leader of one of them, Cadoc by name, received from the
royal treasury a thousand pounds daily for himself and his
men.<a id="Anchor_2102" href="#Footnote_2102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2102.">[2102]</a></p>

<p>Philip’s mastery of the river was still precarious and incomplete
without the reduction of Château-Gaillard. For an
attack upon the Saucy Castle itself, however, his courage
seems as yet to have failed; and striking north-westward by
the road which leads from Les Andelys into the valley of
the Andelle, on the last day of August he again sat down
before Radepont. In two or three weeks it surrendered.<a id="Anchor_2103" href="#Footnote_2103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2103.">[2103]</a>
This time John made no attempt to save it, but fled away
to the depths of his own old county of Mortain,<a id="Anchor_2104" href="#Footnote_2104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2104.">[2104]</a> leaving
Rouen to its fate. Philip however dared not advance upon
Rouen with Château-Gaillard still unconquered in his rear;
and at the opening of the vintage-season he moved back to
Les Andelys and girded himself up for his task. A brief
survey of the Rock convinced him that assault was well-nigh
hopeless; his best chance was in a blockade. On the
north the Lesser Andely occupied by his mercenaries, on the
west the river commanded by his troops in the island-fort,
sufficed to imprison the garrison. The next step was to dig<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417">ii.417</a></span>
out a double trench two hundred feet deep, starting from the
brow of the hill over against the south-eastern extremity of
the castle-rock, extending northward to the margin of the
lake of Andely and westward to the bank of the Seine, and
completely enclosing the two ravines which furrowed the
sides of the rock. Each line of entrenchment was garnished
with seven <i>bretasches</i> or wooden forts, placed at regular
intervals, each surrounded by a ditch of its own, furnished
with a wooden draw-bridge, and filled with as many soldiers
as it could hold. The rest of the army took up their
quarters in the trenches, where they built themselves little
huts of wood and thatch for a shelter against the wet and
cold of the coming winter—shelter against other foes they
needed none, for they were out of bowshot from the castle<a id="Anchor_2105" href="#Footnote_2105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2105.">[2105]</a>—and
whiled away their time in jesting and making songs in
mockery of the straits to which the Saucy Castle was reduced—“So
many thousands girt about with a single
girdle,”—“The eyrie overcrowded with nestlings, who will
have to turn out when the spring comes.”<a id="Anchor_2106" href="#Footnote_2106" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2106.">[2106]</a> The greater
part of the “nestlings” were turned out before the spring
came. The blockade once formed, Roger de Lacy soon
perceived the terrible blunder he had made in admitting
within his walls the townsfolk of the Lesser Andely. According
to one computation, the number of these non-combatants
now huddled within the castle-enclosure was no
less than two thousand two hundred souls; at the lowest
reckoning, they seem to have amounted to fourteen hundred—all,
in a military point of view, simply useless mouths,
devouring in a few weeks the stores of food that should have
furnished rations for a year and more to the little garrison
which was amply sufficient to hold the castle for John. One
day, therefore, Roger opened the castle-gate and turned out
five hundred of the oldest and weakest. They were suffered
to pass unmolested through the blockading lines, and were
followed a few days later by five hundred more. Philip<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418">ii.418</a></span>
however, who meanwhile had returned to his own dominions,
no sooner heard what was going on than he issued strict
orders that every man, woman or child, of whatever age or
condition, who might issue from the castle should be driven
back again without mercy. A large number still remained
of whom Roger was as eager to be rid as Philip was anxious
that he should be obliged to keep them. He took account
of his stores, and found that he had enough to feed the
regular garrison for a whole year. Hereupon he called
together all the remaining non-combatants, and sent them
forth, as they thought, to rejoin their families and friends.
To their horror, as soon as they approached the French lines,
they were overwhelmed with a volley of arrows. They
rushed back to the castle-gate, only to find it closed against
them. For three months this multitude of people dragged
out a wretched existence in the ravines around the fortress,
with no shelter against the wet and the cold but what they
might find in the clefts of the rock, and no food but the dry
leaves and scant herbage which they could pick up at its
foot, and the flesh of the dogs which the garrison soon let
loose for the purpose of yet further economizing their rations.
This last resource was exhausted, and the horrors of cannibalism
were already reached, when Philip came back to see
how the siege was progressing. As he was crossing the
bridge to the island-fort these unhappy beings caught sight
of him and lifted up their voices in agonizing appeal; the
king, moved with a tardy compassion, and perhaps also by
fear of the not improbable outbreak of a pestilence which
might easily have spread into his own entrenchments,
ordered that immediate relief should be given to all who
survived. These however amounted to no more than half
of the original number, which seems to have been something
over four hundred; and most of them had been
so long without food that their first meal proved fatal.<a id="Anchor_2107" href="#Footnote_2107" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2107.">[2107]</a></p>

<p>The last act of this tragedy must have taken place soon
after Christmas. For three months the whole military power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419">ii.419</a></span>
of the French Crown had been concentrated on the investment
of Château-Gaillard; and in all this time John had
done absolutely nothing. From his expedition to the Breton
border he had indeed returned to Rouen for a few days in
the beginning of October. Not a hand did he lift, however,
to check the progress of the blockade which was being
formed almost before his eyes. Soon he was again far away
in the Bessin; thence he suddenly moved across the duchy
to Verneuil, and in the second week of November he was
once more at Rouen.<a id="Anchor_2108" href="#Footnote_2108" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2108.">[2108]</a> It was probably during one of these
visits to the capital that he wrote to Roger de Lacy: “We
thank you for your good and faithful service, and desire that,
as much as in you lies, you will persevere in the fealty and
homage which you owe us, that you may receive a worthy
meed of praise from God and from ourselves, and from all
who know your fidelity to us. If, however, which God forbid,
you should find yourselves in such straits that you can hold out
no longer, then do whatsoever our trusty and well-beloved
Peter of Préaux, William of Mortemer and Hugh of Howels
our clerk shall bid you in our name.”<a id="Anchor_2109" href="#Footnote_2109" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2109.">[2109]</a> Whether this letter
ever found its way through the blockading lines into the
castle it is scarcely worth while to inquire. If it did, it failed
to shake the courage or the loyalty of the garrison, although
it must have proved to them what they doubtless guessed
already, that their sovereign had forsaken them, and that
they were serving him for nought. Of the crowning proof
of his desertion they probably remained unconscious until
all was over for them. After dismantling Pont-de-l’Arche,
Moulineaux and Montfort,<a id="Anchor_2110" href="#Footnote_2110" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2110.">[2110]</a> John, on November 12, again
left Rouen; for three weeks he flitted aimlessly up and down
the country, from Bonneville and Caen to Domfront and Vire,
and back again to Barfleur and Cherbourg;<a id="Anchor_2111" href="#Footnote_2111" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2111.">[2111]</a> on December 6
he quitted Normandy altogether;<a id="Anchor_2112" href="#Footnote_2112" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2112.">[2112]</a> and while the burghers of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420">ii.420</a></span>
the Lesser Andely were starving and freezing to death in the
valleys round Château-Gaillard, and the garrison of the castle
were anxiously reckoning how much longer their provisions
would enable them to hold out for his sake, he was keeping
his Christmas feast at Canterbury at the expense of Archbishop
Hubert.<a id="Anchor_2113" href="#Footnote_2113" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2113.">[2113]</a></p>

<p>By the end of February 1204<a id="Anchor_2114" href="#Footnote_2114" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2114.">[2114]</a> Philip grew impatient of
the blockade of Château-Gaillard, and probably also uneasy
lest John should return from England with an overwhelming
force for its relief. He therefore resolved to try whether it
could not, after all, be taken by assault. He himself took
up his station at the central point of the entrenchment, on
the crest of the hill, facing the narrow neck of land by which
it was joined to the castle-rock. This isthmus, the only
direct approach to the castle itself, he caused to be levelled
and widened till he could erect upon it a wooden gallery or
covered way leading from his own lines up to the edge of the
outermost ditch of the fortress. When, with considerable
difficulty and loss of life, this was accomplished, he caused a
<i>beffroy</i> or wooden tower on wheels to be carried through the
gallery, set up when it reached the further end, and moved
along the edge of the fosse, the cross-bowmen with whom it
was filled doing deadly execution upon the soldiers on the
ramparts, who however made a gallant defence. Meanwhile,
the French were bringing through their covered way earth,
wood, stones, turf, everything they could find to fill up the
ditch. Before it was half full they lost patience and adopted
a quicker method of approach. They dropped down the
perpendicular counterscarp by means of their scaling-ladders,
and set these up again on the sloping inner side of the ditch,
under the foot of the great round tower which formed the
head of the first ward. The ladders were too short for the
ascent; but despite a heavy fire of stones and arrows from
the tower, the storming-party scrambled up, crawling on
hands and knees, or using their swords and daggers by way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421">ii.421</a></span>
of Alpine-staves, till the base of the wall was reached. Then,
while a shower of missiles rattled down upon the shields held
over them by their comrades, the sappers dug and hewed at
the foundations till the tower was undermined; the fuse was
inserted and fired, and the miners had just had time to withdraw
when a large portion of the wall fell crashing into the
ditch. The French rushed to the breach; Roger de Lacy,
seeing that the first ward was lost, ordered the wooden
buildings within it to be fired; he and his men withdrew
across the drawbridge into the second ward, and when the
fire died down, they saw the ruined fragment of the tower
crowned by the banner of Cadoc.<a id="Anchor_2115" href="#Footnote_2115" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2115.">[2115]</a></p>

<p>The French were one step nearer to the goal; but the
next step looked as impracticable as ever. Between them
and the besieged there yawned another ditch as wide and
deep, there rose another rampart as mighty and as inaccessible
as the first. In vain they prowled about the edge
of the fosse seeking for a point at which they could venture
upon an attack, till a young squire or man-at-arms, by name
Peter, but more commonly known in the camp as “Bogis”
or “Snub-nose,” caught sight of a little window just above
the wall at the south-eastern corner of the rampart.<a id="Anchor_2116" href="#Footnote_2116" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2116.">[2116]</a> This
window was the sole external opening in John’s new building,
which was otherwise accessible only on the inner side, by
two doors, one leading into the storehouse which formed the
lower story, one into the chapel above it, and both opening
towards the courtyard. Bogis at once communicated his
discovery to a few trusty comrades; they reconnoitred the
ditch till they found a somewhat shallower place on its
southern side, where it was possible to scramble down;
thence they crawled along the bottom till they were directly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422">ii.422</a></span>
under the window, and then clambered up the sloping side
to the foot of the wall. By standing on the shoulders of a
comrade Bogis managed to reach the window; he found it
unbarred, unguarded, and wide enough for his body to pass
through; he sprang in, let down to his companions a rope
which he had brought for the purpose, and drew them up one
by one till they were all safe inside the building, which proved
to be the storehouse under the chapel.<a id="Anchor_2117" href="#Footnote_2117" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2117.">[2117]</a> Finding the door
locked, they began to hammer at it with the hilts of their
daggers. This noise and the shouts with which they accompanied
it soon alarmed the garrison. They, thinking that
the French had entered the new building and occupied it in
force, hastily set it on fire; unhappily, the wind caught the
flames and spread them in a few minutes over the whole
enclosure. The garrison fled to their sole remaining refuge,
the citadel; Bogis and his companions escaped out of the
blazing ruins into the casemates; the bulk of the French
host, anxiously watching the scene from the opposite side of
the ditch, thought they had all perished; but when the flames
died down and the smoke began to clear away, Bogis himself
appeared at the gate and let down the drawbridge for the
army to pass over in triumph.<a id="Anchor_2118" href="#Footnote_2118" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2118.">[2118]</a></p>

<p>Philip’s engines and their own too hastily-kindled fires
had made havoc among the besieged garrison; they were
now reduced to a hundred and eighty fighting-men.<a id="Anchor_2119" href="#Footnote_2119" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2119.">[2119]</a> Even
this small number, however, might have sufficed to hold for
an indefinite time the remains of Richard’s matchless fortress,
but for one strange error on the part of the royal architect.
Richard had indeed taken the precaution of making the sole
gate of his citadel open not directly towards the courtyard
of the second ward, but at a much less accessible point to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423">ii.423</a></span>
the north-eastward, where only a narrow strip of ground
intervened between the counterscarp of the ditch and the
outer rampart. Most unaccountably, however, instead of
furnishing this gate with a drawbridge, he left a portion of
the rock itself to serve as a natural passage over the ditch
hollowed out beneath it. Across this immovable bridge a
machine known by the name of “cat”—a sort of tent upon
wheels, moved by the men inside it—was, as the epic bard
of the siege expresses it, “made to crawl” close up to the
gate, which the sappers, hidden under this shelter, at once
began to undermine. Roger de Lacy, alarmed no doubt by
the fate of the first tower which had been thus dealt with,
tried the effect of a countermine, which was so far successful
that the French were for a moment compelled to retire; but
the “cat” was speedily replaced by a mighty engine discharging
heavy stones with immense force. At the third
discharge, the wall, undermined as it was from both sides,
suddenly fell in. The French troops poured through the
breach; Roger and his little band were quickly surrounded,
and it was no fault of theirs that they were not slaughtered
to a man, for every one of them refused to yield, and was
only disarmed by main force. The hundred and twenty
men-at-arms and thirty-six knights who still remained were,
however, made prisoners without further bloodshed; and
thus, on March 6, 1204, Philip became master of Château-Gaillard.<a id="Anchor_2120" href="#Footnote_2120" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2120.">[2120]</a></p>

<p>On that March day the king of England really lost not
only his Saucy Castle, but his whole continental dominions
north of Loire. Thenceforth all resistance in Normandy
was at an end; and in three months the whole duchy laid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424">ii.424</a></span>
itself without a struggle at the victor’s feet. Soon after
John’s departure over sea Philip had opened negotiations
with the citizens of the chief Norman towns, representing to
them that the king of England had deserted them, that he
himself was their rightful overlord and sovereign, and bidding
them either receive him as such, or prepare to be all hanged
or flayed alive when he should have overcome their resistance
by force. After some discussion they made a truce with
him for a year, promising that if no succour came from
England within that time, they would submit to him without
reserve.<a id="Anchor_2121" href="#Footnote_2121" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2121.">[2121]</a> On the fall of Château-Gaillard they all, together
with the constables of the remaining fortresses throughout
John’s trans-marine dominions, sent messages to John setting
forth the difficulties of their position and remonstrating
earnestly with him on his tardiness in coming to their aid.
He bade them look for nothing from him, but do each of
them whatsoever they might think good.<a id="Anchor_2122" href="#Footnote_2122" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2122.">[2122]</a> A few weeks
later he despatched the bishops of Norwich and Ely with the
earls of Pembroke and Leicester to see if there was any
possibility of coming to terms with the king of France.<a id="Anchor_2123" href="#Footnote_2123" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2123.">[2123]</a>
But it was too late. Philip sarcastically retorted that the
first preliminary to peace must be the restoration of
Arthur;<a id="Anchor_2124" href="#Footnote_2124" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2124.">[2124]</a> and on the Sunday after Easter he marched again
into Normandy. Falaise surrendered after a week’s siege;<a id="Anchor_2125" href="#Footnote_2125" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2125.">[2125]</a>
Domfront, Séez, Lisieux, Caen, Bayeux, Barfleur, Cherbourg,
Coutances,<a id="Anchor_2126" href="#Footnote_2126" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2126.">[2126]</a> opened their gates at his mere approach. Meanwhile
Guy of Thouars, who had been governing Britanny
since Arthur’s death,<a id="Anchor_2127" href="#Footnote_2127" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2127.">[2127]</a> with four hundred knights and an
immense host of Bretons attacked and burned the Mont-<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Michel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425">ii.425</a></span>
sacked Avranches, and marched ravaging and burning
through the Bessin to join the king at Caen. Philip
sent them back again, together with the count of Boulogne,
William des Barres, a large body of French knights, and a
troop of John’s mercenaries who had changed sides after the
surrender of Falaise, to finish the subjugation of Mortain
and the Avranchin,<a id="Anchor_2128" href="#Footnote_2128" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2128.">[2128]</a> while he himself returned to complete
his conquest of eastern Normandy. Only three important
places were still unsubdued there: Arques on the northern
coast, Verneuil on the southern border, and Rouen itself.
The three bodies of soldiers and townsfolk came to a mutual
understanding whereby those of the capital, on the Tuesday
in Rogation-week—June 1—made a truce with Philip for
thirty days, stipulating that their brethren at Arques and
Verneuil should receive the same benefit if they applied
for it within a certain time, and promising in the name of all
alike that if no succour came from John within the specified
interval, they would give themselves up unreservedly to the
king of France.<a id="Anchor_2129" href="#Footnote_2129" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2129.">[2129]</a> None of them, however, waited for the
expiration of the truce. On midsummer-day Rouen opened
its gates;<a id="Anchor_2130" href="#Footnote_2130" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2130.">[2130]</a> Arques and Verneuil followed its example,<a id="Anchor_2131" href="#Footnote_2131" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2131.">[2131]</a> and
Normandy was won.</p>

except the strongholds of Chinon and Loches, was already
secured; Aquitaine alone still remained to be conquered.
This, indeed, was likely to prove a more difficult task; for
however bitterly the men of the south might hate their
Norman or Angevin rulers, their chances of regaining or
preserving their independence under a sovereign who must
henceforth be parted from them by the whole width of the
Bay of Biscay would be obviously so much better than under
one whose direct sway now stretched all along the northern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426">ii.426</a></span>

they were certain to veer round at once to the side of John,
simply for the purpose of keeping Philip out. Such was in
fact the result throughout the whole country south of the
Dordogne; Savaric of Mauléon, lately John’s enemy and
prisoner, at once became his most energetic and devoted
champion;<a id="Anchor_2133" href="#Footnote_2133" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2133.">[2133]</a> while Angoulême was secured for John as the

<p>John, however, was now at last threatening an attack
from over sea. Three weeks after his return to England, in
January 1204, he had held a council at Oxford and compelled
all the tenants-in-chief, including the bishops and
abbots, to promise a scutage of two marks and a half on the
knight’s fee,<a id="Anchor_2144" href="#Footnote_2144" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2144.">[2144]</a> and a contribution, from which even the parish
churches were not exempt, of a seventh of all moveable
goods;<a id="Anchor_2145" href="#Footnote_2145" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2145.">[2145]</a> all under the plea of gathering a great host for the
recovery of his lost dominions.<a id="Anchor_2146" href="#Footnote_2146" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2146.">[2146]</a> In May he held a council
at Northampton,<a id="Anchor_2147" href="#Footnote_2147" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2147.">[2147]</a> which resulted in a summons to the fleet
and the host to meet him at Porchester at Whitsuntide,
prepared to accompany him over sea. When all was ready,
however, the expedition was countermanded, at the urgent
entreaty, it was said, of Archbishop Hubert and William the
Marshal, the latter of whom had lately returned from Gaul,
and might therefore be supposed to know the condition of
affairs there better than the king could know it himself.
John, after a great shew of resistance, yielded to their entreaties;
the soldiers and sailors were made to pay a fine
in commutation of their services, and dismissed, grumbling
bitterly, to their homes.<a id="Anchor_2148" href="#Footnote_2148" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2148.">[2148]</a> The king gained a considerable
sum of money by the transaction; and the primate and the
marshal, in their boundless loyalty, were content to take
upon themselves the burthen of its shame, which John felt,
or affected to feel, so keenly that he actually put to sea with
a small escort several days after the dispersion of the fleet.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428">ii.428</a></span>
He landed again, however, at Wareham on the third day,<a id="Anchor_2149" href="#Footnote_2149" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2149.">[2149]</a>
and contented himself with sending his half-brother Earl
William of Salisbury and his own son Geoffrey with a body
of knights to reinforce the garrison of La Rochelle.<a id="Anchor_2150" href="#Footnote_2150" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2150.">[2150]</a> A
year later he again assembled his fleet at Portsmouth;<a id="Anchor_2151" href="#Footnote_2151" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2151.">[2151]</a> and
this time he led it in person direct to La Rochelle. He
landed there on June 7,<a id="Anchor_2152" href="#Footnote_2152" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2152.">[2152]</a> and marched to Montauban, which
he besieged and captured;<a id="Anchor_2153" href="#Footnote_2153" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2153.">[2153]</a> the fickle viscount of Thouars,
being now in revolt against Philip, speedily joined him;<a id="Anchor_2154" href="#Footnote_2154" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2154.">[2154]</a>
they advanced to Angers together, won it on September 6,<a id="Anchor_2155" href="#Footnote_2155" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2155.">[2155]</a>
ravaged Anjou with fire and sword, and were doing the like
in south-eastern Britanny<a id="Anchor_2156" href="#Footnote_2156" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2156.">[2156]</a> when Philip again crossed the
Loire and harried the viscounty of Thouars under their very
eyes.<a id="Anchor_2157" href="#Footnote_2157" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2157.">[2157]</a> John at once proposed a truce; the terms were
formally drawn up at Thouars on October 26;<a id="Anchor_2158" href="#Footnote_2158" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2158.">[2158]</a> but when
the English king’s signature was required, he was no longer
to be found. He had slipped away the night before, and
was out of reach at La Rochelle;<a id="Anchor_2159" href="#Footnote_2159" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2159.">[2159]</a> and thence, on December
12, he sailed for England once more.<a id="Anchor_2160" href="#Footnote_2160" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2160.">[2160]</a></p>

<p>Of the two devoted English ministers who had stood by
him through so much obloquy, only the Marshal was now
left. A month after the humiliating scene at Porchester in
1205, Archbishop Hubert died.<a id="Anchor_2161" href="#Footnote_2161" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2161.">[2161]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429">ii.429</a></span>“Now for the first time
am I truly king of England!” was the comment of his ungrateful
master upon the tidings of his death.<a id="Anchor_2162" href="#Footnote_2162" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2162.">[2162]</a> The words
were words of ill omen for John himself, even more than for
his people. He was indeed king of England, and of England
alone. The prophecy of Merlin, which had been working
itself out for a hundred years in the history of the Norman
and Angevin houses, was fulfilled in yet one more detail:
“the sword was parted from the sceptre.”<a id="Anchor_2163" href="#Footnote_2163" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2163.">[2163]</a> The sword of
Hrolf the Ganger and William the Conqueror, of Fulk the
Red and Fulk the Black, had fallen from the hand of their
unworthy descendant. The sceptre of his English forefathers
was left to him. But the England over which he
had to wield it was no longer the exhausted and divided
country which had been swallowed up almost without an
effort in the vast dominions of the young Count Henry of
Anjou. It was an England which was once more able to
stand alone—a new England which had been growing up
under the hands of Henry himself, of his ministers, and of
the ministers of his successor, silently and imperceptibly,
they themselves knew not when or how; and between this
new England and its stranger-king the day of reckoning was
now to come.</p>

<span class="note_title">THE DEATH OF ARTHUR.</span></h4>

<p>Only two contemporary writers even pretend to give a circumstantial
account of Arthur’s death: the Annalist of Margam and
William of Armorica. The former tells us that John, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post prandium,
ebrius et dæmonio plenus</span>” [did John, as well as Richard, make the
demon-blood answerable for his sins?], slew Arthur with his own
hand, and having tied a great stone to the body, flung it into the
Seine; thence it was drawn up in a fisherman’s net, recognized, and
buried secretly, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">propter metum tyranni</span>,” in Notre-Dame-des-Prés
(<cite><abbr title="Annales de Margam" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ann. Margam</abbr>, <abbr title="year">a.</abbr> 1204; Luard, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Annales Monastici">Ann. Monast.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 27</cite>).
William allows the murderer no such excuse, if excuse it be, but
works up the story into a long and horrible romance, in which John
deliberately and of set purpose takes Arthur out alone with him by
night in a boat on the Seine, plunges a sword into his body, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430">ii.430</a></span>
then rows along for three miles before he flings the corpse overboard (<cite><abbr title="William of Armorica">Will.

Franc. Scriptt.</abbr></i>,
<abbr title="volume 5">vol. v.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 166, 167</cite>). Both these writers place the scene at Rouen.

transfers it to Cherbourg: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Apud Cæsaris-burgum duxit, et ibi proditorie
et tyrannice eum in mare submersit.</span>” Rigord says not a
word of the matter. <cite><abbr title="Ralph of">R. Coggeshall</abbr> (Stevenson, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 145)</cite> only speaks
of it incidentally, saying that Philip “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sæviebat <span class="dots">...</span> permaxime pro
nece Arthuri, quem in Sequanâ submersum fuisse audierat</span>.” <cite><abbr title="Roger of Wendover">Rog. Wend.</abbr> (Coxe, <abbr title="volume 3">vol. iii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 170)</cite> says merely “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">subito evanuit</span>.” <cite><abbr title="Matthew">Mat.</abbr>
Paris in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Chronica Majora">Chron. Maj.</abbr></i> (Luard, <abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 480)</cite> copies this, and adds:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modo fere omnibus ignorato; utinam non ut fama refert</span>.” In
<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historia Anglorum">Hist. Angl.</abbr></i> (Madden, <abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 95)</cite> he gives three stories as currently
reported: accidental drowning, death from grief, and the
third, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipsum manibus vel præcepto regis Johannis fuisse peremptum</span>”—this
last being the assertion of the French, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quibus propter hostilitatem
plena fides non est adhibenda</span>.” But his own words in the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Chronica Majora">Chron. Maj.</abbr></i> shew that he could not wholly reject the unavoidable
conclusion of John’s guilt.</p>

<p>The date of Arthur’s disappearance or death is given only by
the Margam annalist. He places it on Maunday Thursday; but
unluckily he has damaged his own authority on chronological matters
by putting the whole affair a year too late, viz. in 1204 instead
of 1203. <abbr title="William of Armorica">Will. Armor.</abbr>, on the other hand, tells us that for three
days before the murder John was at Moulineaux, near Rouen.
These two chronological indications do not exactly agree, for in
1203 Maunday Thursday was April 3, and the <cite><i><abbr title="Itinerary of King John">Itin. K. John</abbr></i>, <abbr title="year">a.</abbr> 4
(Hardy, <i><abbr title="Introduction Patent">Intr. Pat.</abbr> Rolls</i></cite>), shews that the king was at Moulineaux
on Wednesday, April 2, but on the two preceding days he was at
Rouen. It is however plain from the after-history that the deed
must have been done shortly before Easter.</p>

<span class="ch2">THE NEW ENGLAND.</span><br />

<span class="ch3">1170–1206.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the eyes of all contemporary Europe the most striking
and important event in English history during the half-century
which had passed away since the accession of Henry
<abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> was the murder of Archbishop Thomas. The sensation
which it produced throughout western Christendom was out
of all proportion both to the personal influence of its victim
during his lifetime and to its direct political results. The
popular canonization bestowed upon the martyr was ratified by
Rome with almost unprecedented speed, in little more than
two years after his death;<a id="Anchor_2164" href="#Footnote_2164" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2164.">[2164]</a> the stream of pilgrims which
flowed to his shrine, from the east and from the west, from
the north and from the south, was such as had hardly been
seen even at the “threshold of the Apostles” or at the Holy
Sepulchre itself; and it flowed on without a break for more
than three hundred years. Yet Pope and pilgrims all alike
were probably as blind as Thomas himself had been to the
true significance for England of his life and his death. The
great ecclesiastical struggle of which he was the hero and
the martyr marks a turning-point in the social history of
the reign of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> even more than in its political history.
With the quarrel between Henry and Thomas the direction
of the moral and intellectual revival whose growth we have
in earlier chapters endeavoured to trace from the accession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432">ii.432</a></span>
of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> to the death of Archbishop Theobald passed
altogether out of the hands in which it had prospered so
long and so well—the hands of the higher clergy and the
monastic orders. The flight of Thomas scattered to the
winds the little band of earnest churchmen who had been
sharers with him in the inheritance of Theobald’s policy and
Theobald’s work, and left the reforming party in the Church
without a rallying-point and without a leader. One man
alone still remained among the higher clergy who under
more favourable circumstances might have taken up the
work with a far more skilful hand than that of Thomas himself;
but the leadership of Gilbert Foliot was made impossible
by the subsequent course of events, which ranged all
the religious opinion and all the popular sympathies of
England on the side of the persecuted and martyred primate,
and set Gilbert, as the primate’s most conspicuous adversary,
in the light of an enemy to the Church, a rebel against her
divine authority, and almost a denier of her faith.<a id="Anchor_2165" href="#Footnote_2165" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2165.">[2165]</a></p>

<p>The final settlement of the controversy was in some
sense a defeat of both parties; but the one which seemed to
have gained the victory really suffered the heaviest loss.
The king was indeed compelled to abandon his scheme for
reforming the morals of the priesthood by the strong hand
of his royal justice; the privilege of the clergy was saved, to
fall at last before another King Henry four centuries later.
Yet its staunchest champions must surely have felt their
cause reduced well-nigh to an absurdity when they found
that the first result of its triumph was to secure the primate’s
very murderers from the penalty due to their crime;<a id="Anchor_2166" href="#Footnote_2166" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2166.">[2166]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433">ii.433</a></span>
far greater than the seeming gain of Henry’s surrender at
Avranches was the loss to the English Church involved in
the break-down of Theobald’s plans for the reform of the
episcopate. The cowardice of the bishops during the
struggle left them at its close wholly at the mercy of the
king. The vacant sees, of which there were eight besides
Canterbury, were filled after long delays with secular clerks
wholly subservient to the royal will; and before the end of
Henry’s life the English episcopate was as completely
secularized as it had been in the worst days of his grandfather.
The inevitable consequences followed. As were the
bishops, so, and even worse, were the lower clergy. The
cry against the extortion and tyranny of the diocesan officials
which rang at the opening of Henry’s reign through the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polycraticus</i> of John of Salisbury rang yet more loudly
and bitterly at its close through the pages of Walter Map
and Gerald de Barri; the immorality which had once
stirred the indignant zeal of Henry himself grew more wide-spread
and more frightful year by year, as a direct result of
his own shortsighted and selfish ecclesiastical policy. To
that policy there were, indeed, two honourably marked
exceptions. In 1186 Henry raised to the bishopric of Lincoln
one of the holiest and wisest men then living, Hugh of
Avalon. His dealings with the important and difficult
question of the succession to the metropolitan see itself
appear to have been prompted by equally disinterested
motives. It was not the apathy or procrastination of the
king, but the determination of the monks of Christ Church
to use to the uttermost the favourable opportunity for
asserting their independence, and the difficulty of finding
any willing candidate for such a siege—perilous as the chair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434">ii.434</a></span>
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas was felt to be, that delayed the election of
his successor for two years and a half, and his consecration
for nine months longer still.<a id="Anchor_2167" href="#Footnote_2167" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2167.">[2167]</a> The new Archbishop Richard
was a monk of unblemished character, and though possessed
of little talent or learning, fulfilled his office creditably for
ten years;<a id="Anchor_2168" href="#Footnote_2168" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2168.">[2168]</a>while Baldwin, who took his place in 1185, was a
Cistercian of the best type—a type which, however, was
now rapidly passing away.</p>

Henry, not knowing what to do with the archbishop’s murderers, counselled
or connived at their flight into Scotland. The Scot king and people, however,
shewed such a strong disposition to hang them that they were driven to re-cross
the border
    (<cite><abbr title="Lansdowne Manuscripts">MS. Lansdown.</abbr>, Robertson, <i>Becket</i>, <abbr title="volume 4">vol. iv.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 162</cite>). They then, it
seems, took refuge at Knaresborough, and there lay hid till hunger compelled
them to issue from their lurking-place. Finding themselves everywhere shunned
like wild beasts, they at last in desperation gave themselves up to the mercy or
the vengeance of the king. But the murderer of a priest was legally amenable to
none save an ecclesiastical tribunal; Henry could do nothing with them but send
them on to the Pope; and all that the Pope could do with them was to sentence
them to lifelong exile and penance in Holy Land.

<p>The monastic revival which had shed such brightness
over the earlier half of the twelfth century died down long
before its close. <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard had not yet been seven years
in his grave when John of Salisbury, certainly not a hostile
witness, was compelled to acknowledge that the love of
power and the greed of gain had infected the whole monastic
body, not excepting even the White Monks. Rome
herself soon found it needful to make an attempt, although
a vain one, to curb the arrogance of the military orders.<a id="Anchor_2169" href="#Footnote_2169" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2169.">[2169]</a>
Reformers in the next generation vied with each other
in denouncing the vices and crimes of the Cluniacs and
those of the “white-robed herd, the abominable order” of
Cîteaux.<a id="Anchor_2170" href="#Footnote_2170" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2170.">[2170]</a> The fall of the Cistercians indeed was the most
terrible of all; within the space of two generations their
name, once the symbol of the highest moral and spiritual
perfection which the men of their day were capable of conceiving,
had become a by-word for the lowest depths of
wickedness and corruption. Startling as was the change,
its causes are not far to seek. Pledged though they were
by the origin and primitive constitution of their order to be
a standing protest against the wealth and luxury of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435">ii.435</a></span>
Benedictines, they had nevertheless become, in less than a
hundred years from their first appearance in England, the
richest and most powerful body of monks in the realm. At
the time of their coming, almost the whole extent of arable
land throughout the country was already occupied; the only
resource open to the new-comers was the yet unexhausted
and, as it seemed in England at least, well-nigh inexhaustible
resource of pasturage. They brought to their sheep-farming
the same energy, skill and perseverance which characterized
all their undertakings; and their well-earned success in this
pursuit, together with the vast increase of the wool-trade
which marked the same period, made them in a few years
masters of the most productive branch of English industry.
Temptation came with prosperity. But the more obvious
temptations of wealth, the temptations to ease and vanity
and luxurious self-indulgence, had little power over the stern
temper of the White Monks; it was a deeper and a deadlier
snare into which they fell; not sloth and gluttony, but avarice
and pride, were their besetting sins. In the days of Richard
and John, when we find them struggling and bargaining
almost on equal terms with the king’s ministers and the
king himself, they were indeed a mighty power both in
Church and state; but the foundation on which their power
now rested was wholly different from that upon which it
had first arisen; its moral basis was gone. As an element
in the nation’s spiritual life the Order of Cîteaux, once its
very soul, now counted for worse than nothing.</p>

<p>Still the monastic impulse which had guided so many
religious movements in the past was not wholly dead. On
the continent it was giving indeed fresh proofs of its vitality
in the growth of two remarkable orders, those of Grandmont
and of the Chartreuse, both of earlier origin than that of
Cîteaux, but overshadowed until now by its transcendent
fame. These however had little influence upon English
religious life. The “Good Men” of Grandmont—as the
brotherhood were commonly called—although special
favourites of King Henry, never set foot in his island
realm; the Carthusians reached it only in his last years,
and the few settlements which they formed there never rose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436">ii.436</a></span>
to any great importance.<a id="Anchor_2171" href="#Footnote_2171" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2171.">[2171]</a> Out of all the English monasteries,
of various orders, whose dates of foundation are
known, only one hundred and thirteen arose during the
thirty-five years of Henry’s reign, while a hundred and
fifteen owed their origin to the nineteen troubled winters of
his predecessor. In Yorkshire alone no less than twenty
new houses had been founded under Stephen; only eleven
were founded there under Henry.<a id="Anchor_2172" href="#Footnote_2172" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2172.">[2172]</a> Towards the close of
the century, indeed, the reputation of English monachism
had fallen so low that in the high places of the Church a
reaction in favour of secular clerks began to set in once
more. One bishop, Hugh of Coventry, not only ventured
to repeat the experiment which had been vainly tried elsewhere
under the Confessor and the Conqueror, of turning
the monks out of his cathedral and replacing them by
secular canons, but actually proposed that all the cathedral
establishments served by monks should be broken up and
put upon a new foundation of a like secular character.
Hugh himself was however scarcely the man to meet with
general recognition in the capacity of a reformer; and his
bold anticipation of the ecclesiastical revolution which was
to come four centuries later ended in ignominious failure.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437">ii.437</a></span><a id="Anchor_2173" href="#Footnote_2173" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2173.">[2173]</a>
It was, however, no less a personage than Archbishop
Baldwin himself who in 1186 proposed to endow out of
his archiepiscopal revenues a college of secular priests at
Hackington by Canterbury, with the avowed object of providing
a dwelling-place and a maintenance for the scholarship
which monkish jealousy and monkish sloth had all but
driven out of the cloisters where from the days of Theodore
to those of Theobald it had found a home. This scheme
was at once met by a determined opposition on the part
of the monks of Christ Church, who suspected, perhaps not
without reason, that it was part of a design for curtailing
the privileges and destroying the independence of the
metropolitan chapter. They instantly appealed to Rome,
and the appeal opened a contest which absorbed the unlucky
primate’s energies throughout the remainder of his life. He
was steadily supported by the king; but the weight of the
whole monastic body, except his own order, was thrown into
the opposite scale; the general drift of ecclesiastical feeling
still lay in the same direction; and after nearly four years
of wearisome litigation at Rome and almost open warfare at
Canterbury, the building of the new college was stopped by
order of the Pope. The undaunted primate transferred his
foundation to a new site at Lambeth, where it might have
seemed less open to suspicion of rivalry with the Canterbury
chapter; but the jealousy of the monks pursued it with
relentless hatred, and Baldwin’s absence and death in Holy
Land enabled them to secure an easy victory a year later.
The next archbishop, Hubert Walter, took up his predecessor’s
scheme with a zeal doubtless quickened by the fact
that he was himself a secular clerk. The dispute dragged
on for five more years, to end at last in the defeat of the
primate, and, with him, of the last attempt made in England
systematically to utilize the superfluous wealth of a great
monastic corporation for the promotion of learning and the
endowment of study.<a id="Anchor_2174" href="#Footnote_2174" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2174.">[2174]</a> The attempt was made under unfavourable
circumstances, perhaps by unskilful hands; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438">ii.438</a></span>
it was moreover made too soon. In English national sentiment,
monachism was inseparably bound up with Christianity
itself. To the monastic system England owed her conversion,
her ecclesiastical organization, her earliest training as a
nation and as a Church. Even if the guides to whom she
had so long trusted were failing her at last, the conservatism
and the gratitude of Englishmen both alike still shrank from
casting aside a tradition hallowed by the best and happiest
associations of six hundred years. The bent of popular
sympathy was strikingly shewn by an episode in Baldwin’s
quarrel with his monks, when their insolent defiance of his
authority provoked him to cut off all their supplies, in the
hope of starving them into submission. For eighty-four
weeks not a morsel of food reached them save what was
brought by their friends or by the pilgrims who crowded to
the martyr’s shrine; so great however was the amount of
these contributions, some of which came even from Jews,
that—if we may believe the tale of one who was himself an
inmate of the convent at this time—the brethren were able
out of their superabundance to give a daily meal to two
hundred poor strangers.<a id="Anchor_2175" href="#Footnote_2175" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2175.">[2175]</a> As a spiritual force, however,
monachism in England was well-nigh dead. Though it
still kept a lingering hold upon the hearts of the people,
it had lost its power over their souls. It might produce
individual saints like Hugh of Lincoln; but its
influence had ceased to mould the spiritual life of the
nation. The time was almost ripe for the coming of the
Friars.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the decay of holiness and learning in the
cloister was brought into more vivid light by a great outburst
of intellectual vigour of a wholly new type. The
literary activity of the reign of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> had been all but
quenched by the troubles of Stephen’s reign. Chronicler
after chronicler lays down his pen, as if in disgust or despair,
in the middle of the dreary story, till Henry of Huntingdon
and the nameless English annalist at Peterborough are left
to struggle almost alone through the last years of anarchy
to welcome the new king; and he is no sooner crowned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439">ii.439</a></span>
than they, too, pass away into silence.<a id="Anchor_2176" href="#Footnote_2176" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2176.">[2176]</a> The first half of
Henry’s reign has no contemporary historian at all. The
other branches of literature continued equally barren; and
a promise of better things had scarcely dawned in the miscellaneous
treatises of John of Salisbury when the whole
intellectual horizon was darkened by the great ecclesiastical
storm. No sooner had it subsided, however, than the literary
impulse revived under wholly changed conditions. Its bent
was still mainly historical; and, as might be expected, the
first subject-matter upon which it seized was the history of
the new martyr. Within twenty years of his death, no less
than ten different biographies of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas were composed
by writers of the most diverse characters—his old comrade
John of Salisbury, three of his own confidential clerks, a
Benedictine abbot of Peterborough, an Augustinian prior of
Oxford, a monk of Canterbury who was probably an Irishman
by blood, a French poet who had seen the primate in
his chancellor-days, a Cambridge clerk who had joined him
on the eve of his martyrdom. But meanwhile a new school
of English history was springing up in the court instead of
the cloister. Modern research has ascertained that the book
which may fairly be called the foundation-stone of this new
school, as well as the primary authority for English political
history from the death of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas to the third year of
Richard Cœur-de-Lion—- the “Acts of King Henry and
King Richard,” long attributed to Benedict abbot of Peterborough—is
really the work of Richard Fitz-Nigel, bishop
of London and treasurer. Its continuator, Roger of Howden,
was a clerk of the royal chapel and an active and trusted
officer of the royal administration under both Henry and
Richard.<a id="Anchor_2177" href="#Footnote_2177" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2177.">[2177]</a> A third chronicler of the period, Ralf de Diceto,
was archdeacon of Middlesex from 1153 to 1180, when he
became dean of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Paul’s, an office of great political as well
as ecclesiastical importance, which he filled with distinction
until his death in the fourth year of King John.<a id="Anchor_2178" href="#Footnote_2178" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2178.">[2178]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440">ii.440</a></span>
works of these three writers are examples of a species of
historical composition which is one of the most valuable
literary products of the later twelfth century. They are
chronicles in the strictest sense of the word<span class="nobreak">:—</span>records of
facts and events arranged year by year in orderly chronological
sequence, and for the most part without any attempt
at illustration, comment or criticism. But the gap which
parts them from the ordinary type of monastic chronicle is
as wide as that which parted the highly-placed ecclesiastical
dignitary, the trusted minister of the Crown, or the favourite
court-chaplain from the obscure monk who had spent, it may
be, well-nigh his whole life in copying manuscripts in the
scriptorium of Burton or Dunstable or Waverley. Their
writers were not merely chroniclers; they were statesmen
and diplomatists as well. Their position as members of the
royal administration, dwelling in the capital or at the court,
placed them in constant and intimate communication with
the chief actors in the events which they narrate, events
of which not only were they themselves frequently eye-witnesses,
but in which they even took a personal, though
it might be subordinate, share; it gave them access to the
most authentic sources of political intelligence, to the official
records of the kingdom, to the state-papers and diplomatic
correspondence of the time, whereof a considerable part, if
not actually drawn up by themselves, must at any rate
have passed through their hands in the regular course of
their daily business. The fulness and accuracy, the balance
of proportion, the careful order which characterize the work
of these statesmen-chroniclers are scarcely more remarkable
than its cosmopolitan range; Henry’s historiographers, like
Henry himself, sweep the whole known world into the wide
circle of their intelligence and their interest; the internal
concerns of every state, from Norway to Morocco and from
Ireland to Palestine, find a place in the pages of Richard
Fitz-Nigel and Roger of Howden, side by side with the
narrative of their sovereign’s wars with France or with the
text of the various assizes whereby he was reforming the
legal and judicial administration of their own native land.
While, however, the first works of this new historical school<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441">ii.441</a></span>
thus rose far above the level of mere annals, they still stood
far below the literary standard of history in the higher sense,
which had been set up by a monk at Malmesbury half a
century before. The only writer who in the latter half of
the twelfth century, like William of Malmesbury in its earlier
half, looked at history in its true light, not as a mere record
of facts, but according to its old Greek definition, as “philosophy
teaching by examples,” must be sought after all not
in the court but in the cloister. William indeed had left no
heir to his many-sided literary genius; but if some shreds
of his mantle did fall upon any historian of the next generation,
they fell upon one who bore his name, in an Augustinian
priory among the Yorkshire moors.</p>

<p>William of Newburgh was born in 1136 at Bridlington,
a quiet little town lying under the southern escarpment of
the York Wolds, not far from Flamborough Head. Here,
between the bleak uplands and the cold northern sea, a
priory of Austin canons had been founded by Walter de
Gant in the reign of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>;<a id="Anchor_2179" href="#Footnote_2179" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2179.">[2179]</a> from this house a colony
went forth in the early years of Stephen to settle, under the
protection of Roger de Mowbray, first at Hode near Thirsk,
and afterwards, in 1145, at Newburgh near Coxwold.
William entered the new house as a child—probably, therefore,
almost at its foundation; there he passed his whole
life; and there, as the reign of Richard Cœur-de-Lion drew
towards its close, he wrote his <i>English History</i>, from the
Norman conquest to his own day. The actual composition
of the book seems to have occupied little more than two
years; it can scarcely have been begun earlier than 1196,
and it breaks off abruptly in the spring of 1198. The
surroundings of its writer offered comparatively few advantages
for the pursuit of historical study. No atmosphere of venerable
antiquity, no traditions of early scholarship and poetry,
no hallowed associations with the kings and saints and
heroes of old, hung around Newburgh priory; the house was
younger than its historian; the earliest and well-nigh the
only memory that can attract a pilgrim to its now desolate
site is the memory of William himself. No crowd of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442">ii.442</a></span>
devotees from all parts of the realm came thither year by
year to bring their offerings and their news, as they came to
the shrine of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Ealdhelm; no visit of king or prince is likely
ever to have startled the inmates of Newburgh out of the
quiet routine of their daily life; its prior held no such place
among the ecclesiastical dignitaries of his province as the
abbot of Malmesbury had held for ages among the prelates
of the south; he and his canons could have little or no
business with the outside world, and it is hardly conceivable
that any of them would ever have occasion to travel further
than to the mother-house at Bridlington, unless indeed his
own love of enterprise and thirst for a wider knowledge of
the world should drive him further afield. Even in such a
case, however, the undertaking would have been beset with
difficulties; travelling in Yorkshire was still, even under
Henry Fitz-Empress and his son, a more arduous and
dangerous matter than travelling in Wessex under his grandfather.
William, too, had grown up amid those terrible
days when peaceable folk could find no shelter save within
convent-walls, and even that shelter sometimes proved unavailing—when
the men of the north were only too thankful
to wrap themselves in that comparative isolation which
saved them at any rate from sharing in the worst miseries
that overwhelmed their brethren in southern England. The
memories of his boyhood were little calculated to arouse in
him such a spirit of enterprise as had fired the young
librarian of Malmesbury. He seems, indeed, never to have
set a foot outside his native shire; we might almost fancy
that like the first and most venerable of all our historians,
he never set a foot outside his own monastery. The vivid
sketches of town and country which give such a picturesque
charm to the writings of William of Malmesbury are wholly
absent from those of William of Newburgh; there is but one
bit of local description in his whole book, and even that one—a
brief account of Scarborough<a id="Anchor_2180" href="#Footnote_2180" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2180.">[2180]</a>—contains no distinct proof
of having been drawn from personal knowledge of the place.
The brotherhood of Newburgh had, however, ample opportunities
of obtaining authentic, though indirect, intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443">ii.443</a></span>
from the outer world. Their home, in a sheltered spot
under the western slope of the Hambledon Hills, was quiet
and peaceful, but not lonely; for it lay on an old road
leading from York to the mouth of the Tees, and within
easy reach of a whole group of famous monastic establishments
which had sprung up during the early years of the
religious revival in the little river-valleys that open around
the foot of the moors. A few hours’ journey down the vale
of Pickering would bring the canons of Newburgh to brethren
of their own order at Kirkham and Malton; some ten or
twelve miles of hill and moor lay between them and the
famous abbey of Rievaux; another great Cistercian house,
Byland, rose only a mile from their own home. With the
two last-named houses, at least, they were clearly in frequent
and intimate communication; it was indeed at the desire of
Abbot Ernald of Rievaux that William undertook to write
his history; and remembering the important part which the
Cistercians, and especially those of Yorkshire, had played
for more than half a century in English politics, secular
as well as ecclesiastical, we can readily see that his external
sources of information were likely to be at once copious and
trustworthy.</p>

<p>The literary resources of Newburgh itself, however, must
have been of the very poorest; its library, if it possessed
one at all, could only be in process of formation even in
William’s mature years. He himself gives us no clue to its
contents. His style is that of a man of education and taste,
but he shews little trace of the classical scholarship which
may be detected in William of Malmesbury. Only three
earlier writers are mentioned by name in his preface; with
two of these—Bæda and Gildas—he has of course no
ground in common; while the third, Geoffrey of Monmouth,
is named only to be overwhelmed with scorn. It is plain,
however, that William largely used the works of Simeon of
Durham and Henry of Huntingdon; while the fact that his
sketch of the reigns of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> and Stephen is founded
upon the last-named writer seems to shew that his literary
ambition had never been quickened by a sight of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta
Regum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Historia Novella</i>, of which nevertheless his book<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444">ii.444</a></span>
is the sole worthy continuation. Compared with the works
of Richard Fitz-Nigel and Roger of Howden, its faults are
obvious; its details are vague and inaccurate, it is full of
mistakes in names, pedigrees and suchlike small matters, and
its chronology is one long tangle of inconsistencies, confusions
and contradictions. But in the eyes of William of Newburgh,
as in the eyes of William of Malmesbury, the office of
an historian is not so much to record the events of the past
as to explain them, to extract from them their moral and
political significance for the instruction of the present and
the future. His work is not a chronicle; it is a commentary
on the whole history of England, political, ecclesiastical and
social, throughout the twelfth century.<a id="Anchor_2181" href="#Footnote_2181" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2181.">[2181]</a> Such a commentary,
written at such a time and by such a man, is for later
students above all price. The one short chapter in which
William sums up the causes and effects of the anarchy under
Stephen<a id="Anchor_2182" href="#Footnote_2182" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2182.">[2182]</a> is of more real historical worth than the whole
chaos of mere disjointed facts which is all that the chroniclers
have to give us, and in which he alone helps us to discover a
meaning and a moral. The same might be said of many of
his reflections upon men and things, both at home and
abroad. In some respects indeed he contrasts favourably
even with his greater namesake of Malmesbury. If he is
less anxious for the entertainment of his reader, he is more
in earnest about the philosophical bearings of his subject;
he cares less for artistic effect and more for moral impressions;
his stories are less amusing and less graphically told,
but they are untinged with Malmesbury’s love of gossip and
scandal; his aim is always rather to point a moral than to
adorn a tale; he has a feeling for romance and a feeling for
humour,<a id="Anchor_2183" href="#Footnote_2183" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2183.">[2183]</a> but he will ruthlessly, though quietly, demolish a
generally-accepted story altogether, if he knows it to be
false.<a id="Anchor_2184" href="#Footnote_2184" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2184.">[2184]</a> Only once does the judicial calmness of his tone
change into accents of almost passionate indignation; and it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445">ii.445</a></span>
is this outburst which above all has gained for him in our
own day the title of “the father of historical criticism,”<a id="Anchor_2185" href="#Footnote_2185" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2185.">[2185]</a> for
it is the earliest protest against a rising school of pseudo-historical
writers who seemed in a fair way to drive true
history altogether out of the literary field.</p>

<p>Nowhere, perhaps, has the marvellous vitality of the
ancient Celtic race shewn itself more strikingly than in the
province of literature. Of all the varied intellectual elements
that went to the making of the new England, the Celtic
element rose to the surface first. The romantic literature of
England owes its origin to a Welsh monk, Geoffrey of Monmouth,
who became bishop of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Asaph’s about two years
before the accession of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> Long before that time—probably
in the days when poets and men of letters of every
type were thronging to the court of Henry’s grandmother
the good Queen Maude—Walter Calenius, archdeacon of
Oxford, had picked up during a journey in Britanny “a very
ancient book, containing a history of the Britons, from Brut
to Cadwallader son of Cadwallon;” this book he carried
home to England and presented to his friend Geoffrey, begging
him to translate it out of Welsh into Latin.<a id="Anchor_2186" href="#Footnote_2186" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2186.">[2186]</a> Some
years after the death of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> Geoffrey’s translation was
given to the world. Its original cannot now be identified;
but Geoffrey may fairly take to himself the whole credit of
the <i>History of the British Kings</i> to which his name is
attached. The book is an elaborate tissue of Celtic myths,
legends and traditions, scraps of classical and Scriptural
learning, and fantastic inventions of the author’s own fertile
brain, all dexterously thrown into a pseudo-historical shape
and boldly sent forth under the imposing name of History.
The success of Geoffrey’s venture was amazing. The dedication
of the book was accepted by the foremost lay scholar
of the day, William of Malmesbury’s friend and patron,
Earl Robert of Gloucester; its fame spread rapidly through
all sections and classes of society. A Yorkshire priest,
Alfred of Beverley, tells us how some of the clergy of the
diocese, when suspended from the usual occupations of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446">ii.446</a></span>
calling—doubtless by one of the many interdicts which fell
upon them during the struggle between <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> William and
Henry Murdac—beguiled their time by discussing the
stories which they had heard or read about the ancient
British kings; how, his curiosity aroused by their talk, he
with some difficulty borrowed a copy of the new book which
had set them talking; and how he longed to transcribe it
at length, but lacking time and means was obliged to content
himself with an abridgement.<a id="Anchor_2187" href="#Footnote_2187" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2187.">[2187]</a> Norman barons and
ladies heard of the wondrous book and became eager to read
it in their own tongue; a copy was borrowed from Earl
Robert himself by no less a personage than Walter Lespec,
that he might lend it in his turn to a friend of his own,
Ralf Fitz-Gilbert, whose wife wanted her household-minstrel
Geoffrey Gaimar to translate it into French verse for her
entertainment.<a id="Anchor_2188" href="#Footnote_2188" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2188.">[2188]</a></p>

<p>The version of Gaimar was superseded in a few years
by that of Wace, a Norman poet who did a better service to
the cause of history by his later work, the <i lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">Roman de Rou</i> or
riming chronicle of the Norman dukes from Hrolf to Henry
<abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> Neither Alfred nor Gaimar nor Wace seems to have
had any suspicion of the true character of Geoffrey’s book
of marvels; they all alike treated it as genuine history, and
from the point where it closes, at the death of Cadwallon in
689, carried on their narratives without a break down to the
times of the Norman kings. It was against this blurring of
the line between truth and falsehood, this obliteration of the
fundamental distinction between history and romance, that
William of Newburgh lifted up his well-grounded and eloquent
protest in the preface to his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Historia Anglicana</i>.<a id="Anchor_2189" href="#Footnote_2189" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2189.">[2189]</a>
Notwithstanding that protest, the fabulous tales of the <i>Brut</i>
(as Geoffrey’s book is commonly called, from the name of the
first British king mentioned in it) continued to pass current
as an integral part of the history of Britain for many generations
after him. The fraud was in fact countenanced in
high places for political ends; Henry himself was quick to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447">ii.447</a></span>
seize upon it as a means of humouring the national vanity
and soothing the irritated national feelings of those Celtic
vassals who were generally among the most troublesome of
his subjects, but who were also not unfrequently among the
most necessary and useful of his allies. On one occasion
he is said, though on doubtful authority, to have conciliated
the Bretons by consenting to enter into a diplomatic correspondence
with their long-departed, yet still mysteriously
living monarch, Arthur, and by proposing to hold Britanny
as Arthur’s vassal.<a id="Anchor_2190" href="#Footnote_2190" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2190.">[2190]</a> In his last years, however, he turned
the new Arthurian lore to account in a far more significant
way in the island Britain: he set the monks of Glastonbury
to find the grave of the British hero-king. In the cemetery
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Dunstan’s old abbey stood two pyramidal stones, of
unknown age, and covered with inscriptions so old and worn
that nothing could be read in them save, as it was thought,
Arthur’s name. Between these stones, sixteen feet below
the surface of the ground, Henry—so the monks afterwards
declared—guided by what he had heard from an old Welsh
bard and read in the histories of the Britons,<a id="Anchor_2191" href="#Footnote_2191" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2191.">[2191]</a> bade them
look for a wooden sarcophagus containing Arthur’s mortal
remains. The discovery was made in 1191; a coffin, hollowed
as Henry had said out of the solid trunk of an oak-tree,
was dug up on the spot indicated; let into a stone at
its foot was a leaden cross, which when taken out proved to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448">ii.448</a></span>
bear upon its inner face the words, “Here in the isle of
Avalon lies buried the renowned King Arthur, with Guinevere
his wife.” In the coffin were found a few rotten bones,
and a “cunningly-braided tress of golden hair,” which however
crumbled into dust in the hand of a monk who snatched
it up too eagerly. The bones were carefully preserved and
solemnly re-buried under a marble tomb before the high
altar in the abbey-church.<a id="Anchor_2192" href="#Footnote_2192" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2192.">[2192]</a></p>

<p>It is easy to see what was, at any rate in Henry’s mind,
the political significance of this transaction. When Arthur
could be thus publicly exhibited as dead and buried, it was
because the long-cherished dreams of Celtic national independence,
of which his name had been the symbol and the
watchword, were dead and buried too. But the scene thus
enacted at Glastonbury in 1191 had also another meaning
of which perhaps none of the actors in it could be fully
aware. It marked the final “passing of Arthur” out of
the sphere of politics into a wholly new sphere of pure intellect
and philosophical romance. If Geoffrey of Monmouth
corrupted the sources of British history, he atoned for his
crime by opening to the poets of the generation succeeding
his own a fount of inspiration which is hardly exhausted
yet. Their imagination seized upon the romantic side of
these old-world legends, and gradually wove them into a
poetic cycle which went on developing all through the later
middle ages not in England alone, but over the whole of
civilized Europe. But in the hands of these more highly-cultured
singers the wild products of bardic fancy took a
new colour and a new meaning. As usual, it was the
Church who first breathed into the hitherto soulless body
the breath of spiritual and intellectual life. The earliest of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449">ii.449</a></span>
the Arthurian romances, as we possess them now, is a wholly
new creation of the religious mysticism of the twelfth century,
the story of the Holy Grail—</p>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>As one by one the older legends of Arthur and Merlin, the
later stories of Lancelot and Tristan and Gawaine, were
moulded into literary form, a link to bind them all together
was found in the “quest of the Grail,” vowed by the whole
company of Arthur’s knights assembled at the Table Round,
achieved only by one, the Galahad whose pure figure has
gleamed upon all after-time, as it flashed first upon the corrupt
court of the Angevins, the mirror of ideal Christian
chivalry.</p>

<p>The greater part—certainly the noblest part—of this
vast fabric of romance seems to have been woven by the
genius of one man.<a id="Anchor_2193" href="#Footnote_2193" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2193.">[2193]</a> Every side of the intellectual movement
which throughout the latter half of the twelfth century
was working a revolution in English thought and life is
reflected in Walter Map. Born on the marches of England
and Wales, probably in the early years of the civil war, he
studied at Paris under Gerard la Pucelle, and came home
again, while Thomas Becket was still chancellor, to occupy
some post at court, doubtless that of chaplain to the king.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450">ii.450</a></span>
He came of a family which had already done good service to
the Crown; but once in personal contact with Henry himself,
Walter can have needed no passport to the royal favour save
his own versatile genius. At once a scholar, a theologian
and a poet, an earnest political and ecclesiastical reformer
and a polished man of the world, shrewd and practical, witty
and wise, he soon rose high in the king’s confidence and
esteem. Henry employed him in the most varied capacities—as
a justice-itinerant in England, as an ambassador to the
court of France, as a representative of English orthodoxy
and theological learning at the Lateran council of 1179;
while in the intervals of these missions he was in close and
constant attendance upon the king himself. In addition to
his post in the royal household he held several ecclesiastical
preferments—a canonry at <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Paul’s, the parsonage of Westbury
in Gloucestershire, and the precentorship of Lincoln,
which he resigned in 1196 to become archdeacon of Oxford.<a id="Anchor_2194" href="#Footnote_2194" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2194.">[2194]</a>
By that time his literary work was probably for the most part
done. The only book now extant which actually bears his
name, the treatise <i>De Nugis Curialium</i>—“Courtiers’ Triflings”—is
a fruit of the busy years spent in attendance upon King
Henry from 1182 to 1189. By its title and origin it recalls
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polycraticus</i>; and the difference between the two books
marks the change which had come over the tone of educated
English thought in the quarter of a century that lay between
them. Walter Map was, in all likelihood, as ripe a scholar
as John of Salisbury; but there is nothing scholastic in his
treatment of his subject. His book is far less elaborate in
form and methodical in arrangement than John’s; it has, in
fact, no visible arrangement at all; it is a collection of
miscellaneous notes—scraps of folklore from the Welsh
marches, tales brought home by pilgrims and crusaders from
Byzantium or Jerusalem, stories from the classics, sayings
from the Fathers, fragments of information gleaned from the
by-ways of history, personal anecdotes new and old, sketches
of contemporary life and manners in the world and the
Church, court-news, court-gossip, court-scandal—all, as it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451">ii.451</a></span>
seems, picked out at random from the writer’s private commonplace-book
and flashed in picturesque confusion before
the eyes of the literary public of his day. Yet the purpose
of it all is as earnest as that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polycraticus</i>, though
veiled under a shew of carelessness. Walter appeals to a
wider circle than John; he writes not for a chosen band of
kindred souls, but for all sorts and conditions of men who
know Latin enough to read him, for courtiers and men of the
world who have neither time nor patience to go through a
course of philosophical reasonings and exhortations, but who
may be caught at unawares by “truth embodied in a tale,”
and are the more likely to be caught by it the more unexpected
the shape in which it comes. When Walter stops to
point the moral of his stories—for a moral they always have—he
does it with the utmost tact; more often he leaves his
readers to find the moral for themselves. “I am your
huntsman; I bring you the game; dress the dishes for
yourselves!” he tells them.<a id="Anchor_2195" href="#Footnote_2195" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2195.">[2195]</a> But he strikes down the quarry—if
we may venture to borrow his own metaphor—with a
far more unsparing hand than his predecessor. King Henry
himself, indeed, never was spared in his own court; but it is
in the satirist’s attitude towards the Church that we find the
most significant sign of the times. The grave tone of
righteous indignation, the shame and grief of the Theobaldine
reformers at the decay of ecclesiastical purity, has given place
to bitter mockery and scathing sarcasm. Where John lifts
up his hands in deprecation of Heaven’s wrath against its
unworthy ministers, Walter points at them the finger of
scorn. John turns with eager hope from the picture of
decaying discipline and declining morality, which he paints
with firm hand but with averted face, to the prospect of a reformation
which is to be the spontaneous work of the clergy
and the “religious” themselves; Walter has seen this dream of
reform buried in the grave of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas—perhaps we should
rather say of Theobald—and now sees no way of dealing
with the mass of corruption but to fling it bodily into the
furnace of public criticism and popular hatred. The mightiest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452">ii.452</a></span>
creation of his genius is the “Bishop Goliath” whose gigantic
figure embodies all the vice and all the crime which were
bringing disgrace upon the clerical order in his day. The
“Apocalypse” and “Confession” of this imaginary prelate
have been ascribed to Walter Map by a constant tradition
whose truth it is impossible to doubt, although it rests upon
no direct contemporary authority.<a id="Anchor_2196" href="#Footnote_2196" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2196.">[2196]</a> The satire is in fact so
daring, so bitter, and withal so appallingly true to life, that the
author may well have deemed it wiser to conceal his name.
He is the anonymous spokesman of a new criticism which
has not yet fully discovered its own power; of a public
opinion which is no longer held in check by external
authority, but which is beginning to be itself an independent
force; which dares to sling its pebble at abuses that have
defied king and Pope, and will dare one day to sling it at
king and Pope themselves. That day, however, was still
far distant. Walter’s ideal of perfection in Church and state
is one with John of Salisbury’s, only it is set forth in a
different shape. The moral lesson which lies at the heart of
the Arthurian romances comes home to us the more forcibly
as we remember that the hand which drew Sir Galahad was
the same hand which drew Bishop Goliath.</p>

<p>Side by side with Walter Map, in the foremost rank of
this new school of critics and satirists, stands his probably
younger contemporary, Gerald de Barri. Gerald was born
in 1147 in the castle of Manorbeer, some three miles from
Pembroke. He has left us a vivid picture of his childhood’s
home—its ramparts and towers crowning a lofty hill-top
exposed to all the winds that swept over the stormy Irish
Sea, whirled up the creek that ran up from the Bristol
Channel to westward of the castle, and ruffled with ceaseless
wavelets the surface of the little stream that flowed through
the sandy valley on its eastern side;—its splendid fishponds
at the northern foot of the hill, the enclosed tract of garden-ground
beyond, and at the back of all, the protecting belt of
woodland whose precipitous paths and lofty nut-trees were
perhaps alike attractive to Gerald and his brothers in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453">ii.453</a></span>
boyish days.<a id="Anchor_2197" href="#Footnote_2197" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2197.">[2197]</a> His father, William de Barri, the lord of
Manorbeer, represented one of those Norman families of
knightly rank who had made for themselves a home in South
Wales, half as conquerors, half as settlers, in the days of
Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> His mother, Angareth, was a granddaughter of
Rees Ap-Tewdor, prince of South Wales—a child of his
daughter Nest by her marriage with Gerald the constable of
Pembroke; and the fiery Celtic spirit as well as the quick
Celtic wit which the boy inherited from her shews itself
alike in every act of his life and in every page of his writings.
On both sides he came of a race of fighting-men, and he was
certainly not the least pugnacious of his family. The
countless battles of his life were, however, to be fought with
other weapons than the sword which had won Manorbeer
for his paternal ancestors, and which was soon to win for
some of his mother’s nearest kinsmen—for her half-brother
Robert Fitz-Stephen, her nephews Meiler and Robert and
Raymond, her own brother Maurice Fitz-Gerald—a wider
heritage and a more lasting fame beyond the Irish Sea.
Gerald’s bent towards the clerical profession shewed itself in
his earliest years; as a child he was known at Manorbeer as
“the little bishop.” At three different periods before he
reached the age of twenty-five, he spent some years in study
at Paris, where he also lectured upon rhetoric with considerable
success. He finally came home in 1172, just as King
Henry, having twice passed through South Wales on his
way to and from Ireland, was planning out a new scheme
for the government of the principality. One part of this
scheme was, as we have seen, the delegation of the supreme
authority to the young Welsh prince Rees Ap-Griffith.
Another part was the revival of the policy begun by the
Norman kings of managing the Welsh people through the
instrumentality of the Church, and, to this intent, filling the
ranks of the clergy in Wales with as many foreign priests as
possible. Experience had, however, shewn that men of pure
English or Norman blood were not always the fittest instruments
for such a purpose. A year after Gerald’s birth a
compromise had been tried in the appointment to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454">ii.454</a></span>
bishopric of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> David’s of a prelate who was half Norman
and half Welsh<span class="nobreak">:—</span>David, son of Gerald of Pembroke and
Nest, brother of Maurice Fitz-Gerald and of Angareth the
wife of William de Barri. When Angareth’s son Gerald
came home from Paris in 1172, therefore, the influence of
her family was at its height. The foremost man in South
Wales was her cousin Rees Ap-Griffith; the second was her
brother the bishop of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> David’s. It was only natural that
Gerald, sharing with his uncle the qualification of mingled
Welsh and Norman blood, and already known as a distinguished
scholar of the most famous seat of learning in
Europe, should be at once selected for employment in the
business of reforming his native land. Gerald himself was
eager for the work; he had no difficulty in obtaining from
Archbishop Richard a commission to act as his legate and
representative in the diocese of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> David’s; thus armed, he
began a vigorous campaign against the evil doings of clergy
and laity alike—forcing the people to pay their tithes of
wool and cheese, a duty which the Welsh were always very
unwilling to fulfil; compelling the priests to abandon the
lax system of discipline which they had inherited from the
ancient British Church, and had contrived to retain in spite
of Lanfranc and Anselm and Theobald; excommunicating
the sheriff and deposing the archdeacon of Brecknock themselves
when they dared to resist his authority, and receiving
in 1175, as the reward of his zeal, the appointment to the
vacated archdeaconry.</p>

<p>Early in the next year his uncle, Bishop David, died.
The young archdeacon had just issued victorious from a
sharp struggle in behalf of the see against the bishop of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>

ancient metropolitical rank; and he had managed to kindle
in his fellow-canons a spark of the same ambition. They
saw in him the only man capable of bringing their desire to
fulfilment, and made a bold attempt to obtain him for their
bishop. By this time, however, both King Henry and Archbishop
Richard had learned enough of Gerald’s character to
perceive that, however useful he might be as an archdeacon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455">ii.455</a></span>
in Wales, he was not at all the man to suit their purposes
as bishop of any Welsh see, least of all as bishop of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
David’s. Henry, with a burst of fury, summarily refused the
nomination of the chapter; a long wrangle ended in the
appointment of Peter de Leia, prior of the Cluniac house of
Much Wenlock, to the vacant see. Peter, being a foreigner,
a monk, and a man of no great intellectual capacity, was
utterly unable either to rule his turbulent Welsh flock or to
cope with his self-willed and quick-witted Welsh canons;
Gerald undertook to teach him his duties, but found him
such an unsatisfactory pupil that he soon gave up the task
in disgust, and again betook himself to Paris. There he
remained, studying civil and canon law, and lecturing at the
same time with great success, till the summer of 1180, when
he returned to England, was received by the chapter of
Canterbury at a great banquet on Trinity Sunday, and
thence proceeded into Wales. He found Bishop Peter at
his wits’ end, and the diocese in utter confusion, which he
at once set himself to remedy after his own fashion. Thus
matters went on till 1184, when Henry on his last hurried
visit to England found time to intervene once more in the
troubled affairs of South Wales. He called a council on the
border, summoned Gerald to meet him there, and employed
him to arrange the final submission of his cousin Rees to the
English Crown; and then he dexterously removed the over-zealous
archdeacon from a sphere where he was likely henceforth
to be more dangerous than useful, by making him one
of his own chaplains, and sending him next year to Ireland
in attendance upon John. John came back in September;
Gerald lingered till the following Easter. Two books were
the fruit of this visit: a <i>Topography of Ireland</i>, published in
1187, and dedicated to the king; and the <i>Conquest of Ireland</i>,
which came out under the patronage of Count Richard
of Poitou in 1188. Towards the close of that year, when
Archbishop Baldwin went to preach the Crusade in Wales,
Gerald accompanied him half as interpreter, half as guide.
An <i>Itinerary of Wales</i> forms the record of this expedition,
which was followed by a journey over sea, still in the company
of the archbishop, with whom Gerald seems to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456">ii.456</a></span>
remained in more or less close attendance upon Henry’s
movements until the final catastrophe in July 1189. He
then offered his services to Richard, who sent him home
once more to his old task of helping to keep order in South
Wales. For a while he found favour with all parties;<a id="Anchor_2198" href="#Footnote_2198" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2198.">[2198]</a>
William of Longchamp offered him the bishopric of Bangor,
John, in his day of power after William’s fall, offered him
that of Landaff. Gerald however refused them both, as he
had already refused two Irish sees; he cared in fact for no
preferment short of the metropolitan chair of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> David.
Shut out of Paris by the war between Richard and Philip
Augustus, he withdrew to Lincoln and resumed his theological
studies under its chancellor William, whom he had
known in his earlier college days on the Mont-Ste.-Geneviève,
till in the summer of 1198 he was roused to action once
more by the death of Bishop Peter de Leia. The fight began
at once; the chapter of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> David’s nominated Gerald for the
vacant see; the archbishop of Canterbury, Hubert Walter,
set his face against the nomination; they defied his authority
and appealed to king and Pope; Gerald himself fought his
own battle and that of the see with indomitable courage, at
home and abroad, for nearly four years; but the canons
were less resolute than their bishop-elect, he found himself
at last fighting alone against the world, and in 1202 he gave
up the struggle and withdrew to spend the rest of his life in
the quiet pursuit of letters.<a id="Anchor_2199" href="#Footnote_2199" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2199.">[2199]</a></p>

  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>For nearly thirty years it had been the aim of Gerald’s
highest ambition to be the <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas of his native land.
He had struggled and suffered for the privileges of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
David’s in the same spirit in which Thomas had struggled
and suffered for those of Canterbury, and it is by no
means unlikely that had the occasion ever arisen, he
would have been found ready to follow his model even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457">ii.457</a></span>
unto death.<a id="Anchor_2200" href="#Footnote_2200" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2200.">[2200]</a> But, unlike Thomas, he knew when to yield;
and instead of dying for a lost cause, was content to live for
posterity. Both men have had their fitting reward. Gerald
the Welshman—“Giraldus Cambrensis”—still lives in his
writings under the title won for him by his ardent patriotism;
he lives however for us not as the champion of Welsh
ecclesiastical independence, but as what he has been called
by a writer of our own day—“the father of our popular
literature.”<a id="Anchor_2201" href="#Footnote_2201" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2201.">[2201]</a> Gerald’s first essay in authorship was made at
the age of twenty; he was still busy with his pen when past
his seventieth year;<a id="Anchor_2202" href="#Footnote_2202" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2202.">[2202]</a> and all through the intervening half-century,
every spare moment of his active, restless career was
devoted to literary composition. His last years were spent
in revising and embellishing the hasty productions of these
earlier and briefer intervals of leisure. Even in their more
finished shape, however, they still bear the impress of their
origin. They breathe in all its fulness a spirit of which we
catch the first faint indications in William of Malmesbury,
and which may be described in one word as the spirit of
modern journalism. Gerald’s wide range of subjects is only
less remarkable than the ease and freedom with which he
treats them. Whatever he touches—history, archæology,
geography, natural science, politics, the social life and thought
of the day, the physical peculiarities of Ireland and the
manners and customs of its people, the picturesque scenery
and traditions of his own native land, the scandals of the
court and of the cloister, the petty struggle for the primacy
of Wales and the great tragedy of the fall of the Angevin
empire—is all alike dealt with in the bold, dashing, offhand
style of a modern newspaper or magazine-article. His first
important work, the <i>Topography of Ireland</i>, is, with due
allowance for the difference between the tastes of the twelfth
century and those of the nineteenth, just such a series of
sketches as a special correspondent in our own day might
send from some newly-colonized island in the Pacific to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458">ii.458</a></span>
satisfy or to whet the curiosity of his readers at home. The
book made no small stir in the contemporary world of
letters. Sober, old-fashioned scholars stood aghast at this
daring Welshman’s disregard of all classical traditions and
literary conventionalities, at the colloquialisms of his style,
and still more at the audacity of his stories.<a id="Anchor_2203" href="#Footnote_2203" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2203.">[2203]</a> For Gerald,
determined to entertain his readers no matter by what
means, and secure in their universal ignorance of the country
which he professed to be describing, had raked together all
the marvellous and horrible tales that could be found in
Irish traditionary lore or devised by the inventive genius of
his Irish informants; and the more frightful and impossible
these stories were, the more greedily did he seize upon them
and publish them. Irish scholars, almost from that day to
this, have justly declaimed against Gerald for his atrocious
libels upon their country and its people; yet the fact remains
that, in the words of one of his latest editors, “to his industry
we are exclusively indebted for all that is known of
the state of Ireland during the whole of the middle ages.”<a id="Anchor_2204" href="#Footnote_2204" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2204.">[2204]</a>
His treatise <i>De Expugnatione Hiberniæ</i> is by far the most
complete and authentic account which we possess of the
English or Norman conquest of Ireland. The <i>Topographia</i>,
despite its glaring faults, has a special merit of its own; its
author “must” (as says the writer already quoted) “take
rank with the first who descried the value, and, in some
respects, the proper limits of descriptive geography.”<a id="Anchor_2205" href="#Footnote_2205" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2205.">[2205]</a></p>

<p>A far better specimen of his work in this direction is
his <i>Welsh Itinerary</i>, followed some three or four years
later by a <i>Description of Wales</i>.<a id="Anchor_2206" href="#Footnote_2206" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2206.">[2206]</a> Here Gerald is on
familiar and congenial ground, dealing with a subject which
he thoroughly knows and understands, describing a country
which he ardently loves and a people with whom, although
by no means blind or indulgent to their faults, he is yet
heartily in sympathy, because he is one of themselves. In
these treatises therefore we see him at his very best, both as
a writer and as a man. In his own opinion the best of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459">ii.459</a></span>
his works was the <i>Gemma Ecclesiastica</i>,<a id="Anchor_2207" href="#Footnote_2207" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2207.">[2207]</a> or <i>Jewel of the
Church</i>, a handbook of instructions on the moral and religious
duties of the priesthood, compiled for the clergy of
his own archdeaconry of Brecknock. To modern readers it
is interesting only for the glimpse which it affords of the
social, moral and intellectual condition of the South-Welsh
clergy in his day. In his <i>Mirror of the Church</i><a id="Anchor_2208" href="#Footnote_2208" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2208.">[2208]</a> the
general state of religious society and ecclesiastical discipline,
at home and abroad, is reflected as unsparingly as in the
satires of Walter Map. The remainder of Gerald’s extant
works are of the most miscellaneous character—a half-finished
autobiography, a book of <i>Invectives</i> against his enemies
political and ecclesiastical, a collection of letters, poems and
speeches, a treatise on the <i>Rights of the Church of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
David’s</i>, some Lives of contemporary bishops, a tract
nominally <i>On the Education of Princes</i>, but really occupied
for the most part with a bitter attack upon the characters
of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> and his sons.<a id="Anchor_2209" href="#Footnote_2209" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2209.">[2209]</a> All of them are, more
or less, polemical pamphlets, coloured throughout by the
violent personal antipathies of the writer,<a id="Anchor_2210" href="#Footnote_2210" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2210.">[2210]</a> but valuable for
the countless side-lights which they cast upon the social life
of the period. As we read their bold language, we can
scarcely wonder at Archbishop Hubert’s relentless determination
to put down their author by every means in his
power. But though Gerald the bishop-elect of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> David’s
was no match for the primate of all England, Gerald the
pamphleteer wielded a force against which the religious
authority of the metropolitan and the hostility of the older
race of scholars were both alike powerless. He and his
colleagues in the new school of literature had at their back
the whole strength of the class to which they belonged, a
class of men who were rapidly taking the place of the clergy
as leaders of the intellectual life and thought of the nation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460">ii.460</a></span>
When old-fashioned critics lifted up their protest against
Gerald’s <i>Irish Topography</i>, he boldly carried the book down
to Oxford, “where the most learned and famous English
clerks were then to be found,” and read it out publicly to as
many as chose to come and hear it. “And as there were
three distinctions or divisions in the work, and each division
occupied a day, the readings lasted three successive days.
On the first day he received and entertained at his lodgings
all the poor of the town; on the next day all the doctors
of the different faculties, and such of their pupils as were of
fame and note; on the third day the rest of the scholars,
with the knights, townsmen and many burgesses.”<a id="Anchor_2211" href="#Footnote_2211" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2211.">[2211]</a> If
some of the elder teachers shook their heads, it mattered
little to Gerald; their murmurs were lost in the applause of
a younger generation which hailed him as one of its own
most distinguished representatives.</p>

<p>The spirit which breathes through the pages of Gerald
and Walter is the spirit of the rising universities. The
word “university” indeed, as applied to the great seats of
learning in the twelfth century, is somewhat of an anachronism;
the earliest use of it in the modern sense, in reference
to Oxford, occurs under Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>;<a id="Anchor_2212" href="#Footnote_2212" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2212.">[2212]</a> and the University
of Paris appears by that name for the first time in 1215,<a id="Anchor_2213" href="#Footnote_2213" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2213.">[2213]</a>
the year of our own Great Charter. But although the title
was not yet in use, the institution now represented by it was
one of the most important creations of the age. The school
of Bologna sprang into life under the impulse given by
Irnerius, a teacher who opened lectures upon the Roman civil
law in 1113.<a id="Anchor_2214" href="#Footnote_2214" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2214.">[2214]</a> Nearly forty years later, when Gratian had
published his famous book on the Decretals, a school of
canon law was instituted in the same city by Pope Eugene
<abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>; and in 1158 the body of teachers who formed what
we call the University won a charter of privileges from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461">ii.461</a></span>
Emperor Frederic Barbarossa.<a id="Anchor_2215" href="#Footnote_2215" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2215.">[2215]</a> We have already, in the
course of our story, had more than one glimpse of the
great school of arts and theology which was growing up
during the same period in Paris. There, where the study
of divinity had long found a congenial home under the
shadow of the cathedral church, William of Champeaux in
1109—the year of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Anselm’s death—opened on the
Mont-Ste.-Geneviève a school of logic which in a few years
became the most frequented in Europe. Under his successors,
Abelard and Peter Lombard (the latter of whom was
made bishop of Paris in 1159), the schools of Paris became
the centre of the intellectual life of Christendom.<a id="Anchor_2216" href="#Footnote_2216" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2216.">[2216]</a> Teachers
and scholars from every nation met on equal terms, as
fellow-citizens of a new and world-wide commonwealth of
learning, on the slopes of the “Mount,” and went forth
again to carry into the most distant lands the instruction
which they had acquired. There a Wiltshire lad could
begin a lifelong intimacy with a youth from Champagne;—could
pass from the lectures of Abelard to those of a
master who, though disguised under the title of “Robert of
Melun,” was in reality a fellow-countryman of his own; could
enter the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quadrivium</i> under the guidance of a German teacher,
make acquaintance with Aristotle by the help of another
learned Englishman, and complete his theological studies, it
may be, under the same Robert Pulein whom we saw
lecturing at Oxford some twelve or thirteen years before.<a id="Anchor_2217" href="#Footnote_2217" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2217.">[2217]</a>
There a scholar from the Welsh marches could sit at the
feet of the English master Gerard La Pucelle,<a id="Anchor_2218" href="#Footnote_2218" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2218.">[2218]</a> and another
from the depths of Pembroke could give lectures on rhetoric
and could study theology with William of Blois, who in
after-days came at the call of the Burgundian <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Hugh to
undertake the direction of a school at Lincoln.<a id="Anchor_2219" href="#Footnote_2219" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2219.">[2219]</a> There
Ralf de Diceto was a fellow-student with Arnulf of Lisieux;<a id="Anchor_2220" href="#Footnote_2220" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2220.">[2220]</a>
there, in all likelihood, John of Salisbury met Nicolas
Breakspear and Thomas Becket. Thence, we cannot doubt,
came through some of these wandering scholars the impulse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462">ii.462</a></span>
which called the schools of Oxford into being. The first
token of their existence is the appearance of Robert Pulein
in 1133. From that time forth the intellectual history of
Oxford is again blank till the coming of Vacarius in 1149;
and it is not till the reign of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> has all but closed
that we begin to discern any lasting result from the visits of
these two teachers. Then, however, the words of Gerald
would alone suffice to shew that the University was to all
intents and purposes full-grown. It had its different
“faculties” of teachers, its scholars of various grades; and
the little city in the meadows by the Isis, famous already in
ecclesiastical legend and in political and military history,
had by this time won the character which was henceforth
to be its highest and most abiding glory, as the resort of all
“the most learned and renowned clerks in England.”</p>

<p>On a site less favoured by nature, Oxford’s future rival
was more slowly growing up. A lift of slightly higher
ground above the left bank of the river Grant—better known
to us now as the Cam—on the southern margin of what
was then and for five hundred years afterwards a vast tract
of flood-drowned fen stretching northward as far as the
Wash, there stood at the close of the seventh century—long
before Oxford makes its first appearance in history—a
“little waste chester”<a id="Anchor_2221" href="#Footnote_2221" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2221.">[2221]</a> representing what had once been
the Roman city of Camboritum. At the coming of the
Normans the place was known as Grantebridge, and contained
some three or four hundred houses, twenty-seven of
which were pulled down by the Conqueror’s orders to make
room for the erection of a castle.<a id="Anchor_2222" href="#Footnote_2222" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2222.">[2222]</a> It may be that here, as
at Lincoln, the inhabitants thus expelled went to make for
themselves a new home beyond the river; and a church of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Benet which still survives, and whose tower might pass
for a twin-sister of Robert D’Oilly’s tower of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Michael’s
at Oxford, may have been the nucleus of a new town which
sprang up half a mile to the south-east of the old one, on
the right bank of the Cam. Around this new town there
gathered in the course of the following century a fringe of
religious foundations. The “round church” of the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463">ii.463</a></span>
Sepulchre, clearly a work of the time of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, was probably
built by some crusader whose imagination had been
fired by the sight of its prototype at Jerusalem. A Benedictine
nunnery, part of whose beautiful church now serves
as the chapel of Jesus College, was established under the
invocation of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Radegund early in the reign of Stephen;
an hospital dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> John the Evangelist was founded
at some time between 1133 and 1169 under the patronage
of Bishop Nigel of Ely. This hospital, like most institutions
of the kind, may have been served by canons regular of the
order of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Augustine. Some years before this, however,
the Augustinians had made a more important settlement in
the same neighbourhood. As early as 1092 Picot the
sheriff of Cambridgeshire had founded within the older
town on the left bank of the river a church of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Giles, to
be served by four regular canons. In 1112 this little
college was removed to Barnwell, some two miles to the
north-eastward, on the opposite side of the river, where it
grew into a flourishing Austin priory. Wherever there were
Austin canons a school was sure to spring up ere long; so,
too, we cannot doubt, it was at Cambridge. Whether the
seeds of learning were first sown in the cloisters of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> John’s
or of Barnwell, or under the shadow of that old <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Benet’s
which seems to have been the original University church<a id="Anchor_2223" href="#Footnote_2223" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2223.">[2223]</a>—who
it was that played here the part which had been played
at Oxford by Robert Pulein—we know not; but we do
know that by the middle of the following century the old
Grantebridge had sunk into a mere suburb of the new town
beyond the river, and the existence of the schools of Cambridge
had become an established fact.<a id="Anchor_2224" href="#Footnote_2224" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2224.">[2224]</a></p>

<p>The student-life of the twelfth century—whether it were
the life of scholar or of teacher—had nothing either of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464">ii.464</a></span>
ease or the dignity which we associate with the college life
of to-day. Colleges in the modern sense there were indeed
none. Students of all ranks and ages, from boys of ten or
twelve years to men in full priestly orders, lodged as they
could in a sort of dames’-houses or hostels scattered up and
down the streets and lanes of the city. The schools were
entirely unendowed; there was no University chest, no
common fund, no pecuniary aid of any kind for either
scholars or teachers. The sole support of both was, at first,
the power under whose sheltering wings the school had grown
up—the Church. Every book, even, had to be either bought
out of their own private purses or borrowed from the library
of some religious establishment. We may perhaps gather
some idea of what this latter resource was likely to furnish
in the great educational centres from a catalogue which has
been preserved to us of the library attached to Lincoln
minster, at the time when the Lincoln school of theology
was at the height of its fame under Gerald’s friend William
of Blois and the saintly bishop Hugh. Five-and-thirty years
before Hugh’s appointment to the see, the church of Lincoln
possessed, in addition to the necessary service-books which
were under the care of the treasurer, some thirty or forty
books in the chancellor’s keeping. Among these we find,
besides a number of Psalters, works of the Latin Fathers,
Epistles, Gospels, and a complete Bible in two volumes, the
Canons, Statutes and Decretals of the Popes;—the Decretals
edited by Ivo of Chartres;—the works of Vergil: a copy of
the military treatise of Vegetius, bound up with the Roman
History of Eutropius, “which volume Master Gerard gave in
exchange for the Consolations of Boëthius, which he lost”;—Priscian’s
Grammar<span class="nobreak">:—</span>a “Mappa Mundi”: and a <i>Book of
the Foundation of Lincoln Minster</i>, with a collection of its
charters. Of nine books presented by Bishop Robert de
Chesney, who died in 1166, the most noticeable were the
works of Josephus and of Eusebius, and the <i>Sentences</i> of
Peter Lombard. Somewhat later, one Warin of Hibaldstow
presented to the chapter a “book of Aristotle”—doubtless a
Latin version of his treatise on logic or on natural philosophy—and
seven volumes, whose contents are not stated, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465">ii.465</a></span>
given by Master “Radulphus Niger” or Ralf the Black,
known to us as one of the minor chroniclers of King Henry’s
later years. A copy of Gratian’s great book of Decretals
was presented about the same time by an archdeacon of
Leicester; Gerald de Barri, probably during his residence
at Lincoln at the close of Richard’s reign, added another
law-book called <i>Summula super Decreta</i>, a copy of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Anselm’s treatise <i>Cur Deus Homo</i>, and three of his own
works, the <i>Topographia Hiberniæ</i>, the <i>Life of Bishop
Remigius</i>, and the <i>Gemma Sacerdotalis</i> or <i>Ecclesiastica</i>; and
the list closes with another copy of the <i>Sentences</i>, acquired
seemingly in the early years of the following century.<a id="Anchor_2225" href="#Footnote_2225" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2225.">[2225]</a></p>

<p>The head of the scholastic body was the chancellor, who
was an officer of the diocesan bishop—in the case of
Oxford, the bishop of Lincoln. From him those who had
reached a certain degree of proficiency in the schools received
their license to become teachers in their turn; and it
was an established rule that all who had attained the rank
of Master or Doctor should devote themselves for a certain
time to the work of instructing others. They gave their
lectures how and where they could, in cloister or church-porch,
or in their own wretched lodgings, their pupils sitting
literally at their feet, huddled all together on the bare
ground; their living depended solely on their school-fees,
and these were often received with one hand only to be paid
away again with the other, for many an ardent young teacher
of logic or rhetoric was, like John of Salisbury and Gerald
de Barri, at one and the same time giving lectures in these
arts to less advanced scholars and pursuing his own studies
under some great doctor of theology. The course of study
was much the same everywhere. From the fifth century
downwards it had consisted of two divisions, <i>trivium</i> and
<i>quadrivium</i>. Under the former head were comprised
Grammar, defined by an early teacher as the art of <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466">ii.466</a></span>“writing
and reading learnedly, understanding and judging skilfully;”<a id="Anchor_2226" href="#Footnote_2226" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2226.">[2226]</a>
Dialectics, including logic and metaphysics; and Rhetoric,
by which were meant the rules and figures of the art, chiefly
derived from Cicero. The Quadrivium included Geometry,
not so much the science now known by that name as what
we call geography; Arithmetic, which in the middle ages
meant the science of mystical numbers; Music, in other
words metre and harmony; and Astronomy, of course on
the Ptolemaic system, although as early as the fifth century
a theory had been put forth which is said to have given in
after-days the clue to Copernicus.<a id="Anchor_2227" href="#Footnote_2227" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2227.">[2227]</a> There was a separate
faculty of Theology, and another of Law. Between these
different faculties there seems to have been a good deal of
jealousy. The highest authorities of the Western Church, while
encouraging by every means in their power the study of the
canon law, set their faces steadily against the civil law of
imperial Rome; the “religious” were over and over again
forbidden to have anything to do with it: and on the continent
the two branches of the legal profession were followed
by different persons. As, however, the procedure of the
canon law was founded upon that of the Theodosian code,
the English clerical lawyers in Stephen’s time and in Henry’s
early years found their account in combining the two
studies; by degrees both together passed out of the hands
of the clergy into those of a new class of lay lawyers; and
in later days, while on the continent the canon law fell into
neglect with its exclusively clerical professors, in England it
was preserved by being linked with the civil law under the
care of lay <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">doctores utriusque juris</i>.<a id="Anchor_2228" href="#Footnote_2228" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2228.">[2228]</a></p>

<p>Theology had, however, a yet more formidable rival in
the schools of logic. The text-book commonly used in these
schools was a Latin translation, made by Boëthius in the
sixth century, of part of Aristotle’s treatise upon logic.
Early in the twelfth century the natural philosophy of
Aristotle was in some measure rendered accessible to western
students through translations made by travelled scholars
such as Adelard of Bath from Arabic versions which they
had picked up in the schools of Salerno or of the remoter
East. Of the “Ethics” nothing was known save a few fragments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467">ii.467</a></span>
imbedded in the works of Latin writers, until a
hundred years later, when they found their way back to
Europe, probably in the train of the returning crusaders,
and certainly in a very strange shape—that of a Latin
translation from a Hebrew version of what was, after all,
nothing more than an Arabic commentary founded upon a
Syriac version of the original Greek text.<a id="Anchor_2229" href="#Footnote_2229" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2229.">[2229]</a> Garbled as it
was, however, this new Aristotelian lore revolutionized the
schools of western Christendom by laying open to them
wholly new fields of criticism and speculation. The spirit of
free inquiry in which Adelard had begun to deal with
physical science invaded every region of intellectual thought
and knowledge, while the spread of legal studies helped to
the invention of new methods of argument and disputation.
In vain did Peter Lombard, in the famous book which gained
for him his title of “Master of the Sentences,” strive to stem
the rising tide and counterwork the influence of the rationalizing
dialecticians by applying to the purposes of theology
the methods of their own favourite science. The “Sentences”
remained the accepted text-book of theology down to the
cataclysm in the sixteenth century; but their effect was
precisely the opposite to that which their author had desired.<a id="Anchor_2230" href="#Footnote_2230" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2230.">[2230]</a>
The endless “doubtful disputations,” the hair-splittings, the
“systems of impossibilities,” which had already taken possession
of the logic-schools in John of Salisbury’s day, were
even more irritating to the practical mind and impetuous
temper of Gerald de Barri. They were in fact ruining both
theology and letters. “Our scholars,” Gerald complains,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468">ii.468</a></span>“for the sake of making a shew, have betaken themselves to
subjects which rather savour of the quadrivium<span class="nobreak">:—</span>questions
of single and compound, shadow and motion, points and
lines, acute and obtuse angles—that they may display a
smattering of learning in the quadrivium, whereof the studies
flourish more in the East than in the West; and thence they
have proceeded to the maintaining of false positions, the propounding
of insoluble problems, the spinning of frivolous and
long-winded discourses, not in the best of Latin, hereby
holding up in their own disputations a warning of the consequences
ensuing from their abandonment of the study of
letters.”<a id="Anchor_2231" href="#Footnote_2231" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2231.">[2231]</a> Yet it was from those very schools that Gerald
himself, and men like him, had caught the fearless temper,
the outspoken, unrestrained tone, in which they exposed and
criticized not only every conspicuous individual, but every
institution and every system, alike in the world and in the
Church of their day. The democratic spirit of independence
which had characterized the strictly clerical reformers of an
earlier day had passed from the ranks of the priesthood into
those of the universities, and had taken a mightier developement
there. It was mainly through them that the nation at
large entered in some degree into the labours of Theobald
and his fellow-workers; it was they themselves who entered
into the labours of Thomas Becket. A large proportion of
both students and teachers—a proportion which grew larger
and larger as time went on—were laymen; but an inveterate
legal fiction still counted them all as “clerks.” The schools
had grown up under the wings of the Church, and when they
reached their full stature, they were strong enough both to
free themselves from the control of the ecclesiastical authorities
and to keep the privileges for which the clergy had
fought. A priest of the English Church in our own day is
as completely subject to the ordinary law of the land as any
of his flock; but the chancellor’s court of the University of
Oxford still possesses sole cognizance over all causes whatsoever,
in all parts of the realm, which concern any resident
member of the University.<a id="Anchor_2232" href="#Footnote_2232" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2232.">[2232]</a></p>

<p>Not the universities, however, but the towns, were the
true strongholds of English freedom. The struggle of the
English towns for municipal liberty which we have seen
beginning under Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> was renewed under Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> and
Richard with increased vigour and success. Henry Fitz-Empress
was far too clear-sighted a statesman to undervalue
the growing importance of this element in English social
and political life. Most of his town-charters, however, date<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469">ii.469</a></span>
from the earlier years of his reign, and scarcely any of them
contain anything more than a confirmation of the liberties
enjoyed in his grandfather’s time, with the addition in some
cases of a few new privileges, carefully defined and strictly
limited.<a id="Anchor_2233" href="#Footnote_2233" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2233.">[2233]</a> In the great commercial cities, where the municipal
movement had probably received a fresh impulse from
the extension of trade and intercourse with the continent
which was a natural consequence of Henry’s accession to
the crown, the merchant-gilds soon began openly to aim at
gathering into their own hands the whole powers of local
government and administration, and acquiring the position
of a French “commune.” The French kings encouraged
the growth of the communal principle as a possible counterpoise
to the power of the feudal nobles; Henry, who had
little need of it for such a purpose, saw the dangers which it
threatened to his system of government and held it steadily
in check. In 1170 Aylwine the Mercer, Henry Hund and
“the other men of the town” paid a heavy fine to the
treasury for an attempt to set up a commune at Gloucester;<a id="Anchor_2234" href="#Footnote_2234" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2234.">[2234]</a>
six years later one Thomas “From-beyond-the-Ouse” paid
twenty marks for a like offence at York.<a id="Anchor_2235" href="#Footnote_2235" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2235.">[2235]</a> Owing to the
close connexion between the organization of the commune
and that of the gilds, every developement of this latter
institution also was watched by the Crown with jealous care;
in 1164 the burghers of Totnes, those of Lidford and those
of Bodmin were all fined for setting up gilds without warrant
from the king;<a id="Anchor_2236" href="#Footnote_2236" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2236.">[2236]</a> and in 1180 no less than eighteen “adulterine
gilds” in London met with a similar punishment.<a id="Anchor_2237" href="#Footnote_2237" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2237.">[2237]</a>
Once established, however, they seem to have been permitted
to retain their existence, for in the first Pipe Roll of Richard
we find them again paying their fines “as they are set down
in the twenty-sixth Roll of King Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>”<a id="Anchor_2238" href="#Footnote_2238" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2238.">[2238]</a> A bakers’
gild in London, a weavers’ gild at Nottingham, one of the
same craft and another of fullers at Winchester, make their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470">ii.470</a></span>
appearance as authorized bodies at the opening of Henry’s
reign;<a id="Anchor_2239" href="#Footnote_2239" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2239.">[2239]</a> among the “adulterine gilds” of London were those
of the butchers, goldsmiths, grocers, clothiers and pilgrims.<a id="Anchor_2240" href="#Footnote_2240" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2240.">[2240]</a>
The golden days of English borough-life, however, began
with the crowning of Henry’s successor. “When History
drops her drums and trumpets and learns to tell the story of
Englishmen”—as he who wrote these words has told it—“it
will find the significance of Richard, not in his crusade
or in his weary wars along the Norman border, but in his
lavish recognition of municipal life.”<a id="Anchor_2241" href="#Footnote_2241" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2241.">[2241]</a> In his first seven
years alone, we find him granting charters to Winchester,
Northampton, Norwich, Ipswich, Doncaster, Carlisle, Lincoln,
Scarborough and York. Some of these towns were only
beginning their career of independence, and were content
with the first step of all, the purchase of the <i>firma burgi</i>;
some bought a confirmation of privileges already acquired;
Lincoln in 1194 had got so far as to win from the king a
formal recognition of its right to complete self-government
in a clause empowering its citizens to elect their own reeve
every year.<a id="Anchor_2242" href="#Footnote_2242" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2242.">[2242]</a> King of knights-errant and troubadours as he
seemed, Richard, it is plain, could read the signs of the times
as clearly and act upon their warnings as promptly and as
wisely as any of his race; and we may be very sure that this
bold advance upon his father’s cautious policy towards the
towns was dictated by a sound political instinct far more
than by the mere greed of gain. John went still further in
the same direction; the first fifteen years of his reign afford
examples of town-charters of every type, from the elementary
grant of the <i>firma burgi</i> and the freedom of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471">ii.471</a></span>
merchant-gild to the little Cornish borough of Helston<a id="Anchor_2243" href="#Footnote_2243" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2243.">[2243]</a> up
to the crowning privilege bestowed upon the “barons of
our city of London” in 1215, of electing their own mayor
every year.<a id="Anchor_2244" href="#Footnote_2244" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2244.">[2244]</a></p>

<p>From the charter of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> to the establishment of the
commune under Richard the constitutional history of London
is shrouded in obscurity. The charter granted by Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>
to the citizens, some time before the end of 1158, is simply
a confirmation of his grandfather’s.<a id="Anchor_2245" href="#Footnote_2245" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2245.">[2245]</a> During the first fifteen
years of his reign two sheriffs of London appear annually in
the Pipe Rolls; in 1171 there were four, as there had been
in the thirty-first year of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>; but in the twentieth year
of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, 1171, we find that their number was again
reduced to two; and from 1182 onwards there seems to
have been only one, till at Michaelmas 1189 the accounts
were rendered by Richard Fitz-Reiner and Henry of Cornhill,
both of whom continued in office till 1191.<a id="Anchor_2246" href="#Footnote_2246" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2246.">[2246]</a> In that
year, as we have seen, the commune won its legal recognition
from John and Archbishop Walter of Rouen as
representatives of the absent king;<a id="Anchor_2247" href="#Footnote_2247" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2247.">[2247]</a> and although the charter
which Richard issued to the citizens of London, shortly
before his final departure from England in 1194, is a mere
echo of his father’s,<a id="Anchor_2248" href="#Footnote_2248" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2248.">[2248]</a> yet the existence of the new corporation
is thenceforth a recognized fact. John’s first charter to
London was issued from Normandy six weeks after his
crowning. It renewed the old grant of the sheriffdom of
London and Middlesex, with all rights and customs thereunto
belonging, to the citizens and their heirs, to have and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472">ii.472</a></span>
to hold of the king and his heirs for ever. They were to
appoint as sheriffs any of their own number whom they
might choose, and to remove them at their pleasure; and
for this privilege they were to pay, through the said sheriffs,
three hundred pounds a year to the Treasury.<a id="Anchor_2249" href="#Footnote_2249" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2249.">[2249]</a> The establishment
of the commune had reduced the sheriffs to the
rank of mere financial officers, and the real head of the civic
administration was the mayor. The first mayor of London,
Henry Fitz-Aylwine, retained his office for life; and his life
extended beyond the limits of our present story. Yet the
true significance of that story is strikingly illustrated by the
next step in the history of London, a step which followed
two years after Fitz-Aylwine’s death. On May 9, 1215,
John granted to the “barons of the city of London” the
right of annually electing their mayor.<a id="Anchor_2250" href="#Footnote_2250" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2250.">[2250]</a> Five weeks later
the barons of England compelled him to sign, in the
meadows of Runnymede, the Great Charter which secured
the liberties not of one city only but of the whole English
people; and among the five-and-twenty men whom they
chose from among themselves to enforce its execution was
Serlo the Mercer, mayor of London.<a id="Anchor_2251" href="#Footnote_2251" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2251.">[2251]</a></p>

<p>Little, indeed, as the burghers themselves may have
dreamed of any such thing, the highest importance of their
struggle for municipal liberty lies in this, that its fruits were
to be reaped by a far larger community than was inclosed
within the town-walls. It was from the burghers that their
brethren in the rural districts caught once more the spirit of
freedom which ages of oppression had well-nigh crushed out
of their hearts. “‘Ketel’s case’” at Bury <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s—the
case of a tenant of the abbey who, dwelling “outside
the gate,” was hanged for a theft of which he had been
found guilty by the Norman process of the judicial duel
usual in the manor-courts, and over whose fate the townsmen,
rejoicing in the Old-English right of compurgation
which they still retained, grew so bitterly sarcastic that the
abbot and the “saner part of the convent” were driven by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473">ii.473</a></span>
terror of a peasant revolt to admit their rural tenants to a
share in the judicial franchise of the town<a id="Anchor_2252" href="#Footnote_2252" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2252.">[2252]</a>—was in all
probability only one out of many. The history of this same
abbey of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s shews us how even the villeins were
rising into a position more like that of their free brethren,
how the old badges of serfdom, the heavy labour-rents, the
hard customs, were vanishing one by one, and how in this
process of enfranchisement the boroughs led the way.<a id="Anchor_2253" href="#Footnote_2253" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2253.">[2253]</a> “The
ancient customs belonging to the cellarer’s office, as we have
seen them”—that is, as Jocelyn of Brakelond, who was a
monk of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s from 1172 to 1211, had seen them
in the old custom-roll of the house—<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474">ii.474</a></span>“were these: The
cellarer had his messuage and barn by the well of Scurun,
where he solemnly held his court for the trial of thieves and
of all pleas and quarrels; and there he received the pledges
of his men, and enrolled them, and renewed them every
year, and got gain by it, as the reeve did in the portmannimot.
This messuage was the homestead of Beodric, who
of old time was lord of this township, whence it was called
Beodricesworth; whose demesne lands are now in the
demesne of the cellarer; and what is now called the <i>aver-land</i>
was the land of his rustics. Now the sum of his
tenements and those of his men was three hundred and
thirty acres, which are lands still belonging to the township,
whereof the services, when the town was made free, were
divided into two parts; so that the sacristan or the reeve
should receive the quit-rent, that is, twopence on every acre;
and the cellarer should have the ploughings and other
services, that is, the ploughing of one rood for every acre,
without food (which custom is observed still); he was also
to have the folds wherein all the men of the township (except
the seneschal, who has his own fold) were bound to put
their sheep (this custom, too, is observed still). He was
also to have the <i>aver-penny</i>,<a id="Anchor_2254" href="#Footnote_2254" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2254.">[2254]</a> that is twopence for every
thirty acres; this custom was changed before the death of
Abbot Hugh (1180). For the men of the township had to
go at the cellarer’s bidding to Lakenheath, to fetch a load
of eels from Southrey, and often they came back with their
carts empty, and so they had their trouble without any
benefit to the cellarer; wherefore it was agreed between
them that every thirty acres should pay a penny a year, and
the men should stay at home. At the present time, however,
these lands are so cut up that scarcely anybody knows from
whom the payment is due; so that whereas I have seen the
cellarer receive twenty-seven pence in a year, now he can
hardly get tenpence farthing. Moreover, the cellarer used
to have control over the roads outside the township, so that
no one might dig chalk or clay without his leave. He was
also wont to summon the fullers of the township to lend
cloths for carrying his salt; otherwise he would forbid them
the use of the waters, and seize whatever cloths he found
there; which customs are observed unto this day.” “Moreover
the cellarer alone ought, or used, to have one bull free
in the fields of this township; but now several persons have
them.” “Moreover the cellarer used to warrant those who
owed service to his court, so that they were exempt from
scot and tallage; but now it is not so, because the burghers
say that those who do service at the court ought to be exempt
for their service, but not for the burgage which they
hold in the town, and forasmuch as they and their wives do
publicly buy and sell in the market.”<a id="Anchor_2255" href="#Footnote_2255" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2255.">[2255]</a> After the affair of
Ketel, in fact, the cellarer’s court was merged in that of the
town; “it was decreed that his men should come to the
toll-house with the others, and there renew their pledges,
and be written in the reeve’s roll, and there give to the
reeve the penny which is called <i>borth-silver</i>, and the cellarer
should have half of it (but he gets nothing at all of it
now); and all this was done, that all might enjoy equal
liberty.”<a id="Anchor_2256" href="#Footnote_2256" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2256.">[2256]</a></p>

<p>“That all might enjoy equal liberty”—Jocelyn’s words
had a significance wider and deeper than he himself could
know, wider and deeper than could be known perhaps even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475">ii.475</a></span>
to his abbot from whom they were probably echoed; although
it is clear from almost every page of Jocelyn’s story that
Abbot Sampson of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s was a far more enlightened
and far-seeing statesman than most of the great landowners
of his day, whether secular or tonsured. The rural tenants
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund in his time had evidently made a good deal
more progress towards enfranchisement than those of some
other great houses, such as, for example, the abbey of
Abingdon. In 1185, on the death of Abbot Roger of
Abingdon, a dispute between the “obedientiaries,” or officers
of the convent to whose support various portions of its
revenues were assigned, and the steward appointed by the
king to take charge of the abbot’s property during the
vacancy of his office, led to the drawing-up of a consuetudinary,<a id="Anchor_2257" href="#Footnote_2257" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2257.">[2257]</a>
which it would be interesting to compare with the
earlier “Black Book” of Peterborough. A large proportion
of the tenants’ dues were paid in money; but there were
still considerable remnants of the older system. The chamberlain
of the abbey, for instance, had an acre of land at
Culham, which the men of that township were bound to reap
and carry to make beds for the monks. The hay to be laid
“under the monks’ feet when they bathed” was supplied in
like manner from a meadow at Stockgrave. A tenant named
Daniel of Colebrook was bound, besides paying a rent of five
shillings, to furnish the chamberlain whenever he went to
London with hay for his horses, with wood and salt, and with
straw for his bed. At Welsford, near Newbury, there were
twenty-two “cotset-lands,” whose tenants held them by their
services as swineherds, bedels (or messengers of the chamberlain’s
court), shepherds, hedgewards and such like. Of eleven
rent-paying tenants in the same township, one owed, besides
his rent of twenty-seven pence, his personal service for
getting in hay and stacking corn in August. As the whole
township was in demesne, its inhabitants paid a tribute to
the lord—in this case the chamberlain of the abbey—for
the pannage of their pigs; they had also to furnish the
services of one man for harvesting in August, and to lend
their ploughs for bene-work. The men of Boxhole, Benham,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476">ii.476</a></span>
Easton and Weston did the like. At Boxhole, out of twelve
tenants, eight were bound, besides paying their rent, to
plough an acre of the demesne and sow it with their own
seed; and seven of these had moreover to carry hay and
corn. One Berner and his sons held a “cotset-land” by a
rent of six sextaries of honey to the cellarer and thirty-one
pence to the chamberlain.<a id="Anchor_2258" href="#Footnote_2258" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2258.">[2258]</a> There were twenty-six tenants
withdrawn from demesne, of whom six owed work in August,
in addition to their rent; and there were five acres of meadow
which had to be mowed and carried by five men of the
township. At Benham, out of twenty-four tenants, eleven
were “cotsetles”; three of these were servants of the chamberlain,
holding their lands by their service; the rest were
to hold by rent or by work, as the lord might choose<a id="Anchor_2259" href="#Footnote_2259" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2259.">[2259]</a>—an
arrangement which applied also to the cotters of Boxhole.<a id="Anchor_2260" href="#Footnote_2260" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2260.">[2260]</a>
Of the remaining thirteen tenants at Benham, six paid rent
only; the rest were bound also to plough and sow an acre
or half an acre apiece, and to carry corn and hay.<a id="Anchor_2261" href="#Footnote_2261" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2261.">[2261]</a> One
was excused the ploughing and sowing, doubtless in consideration
of her sex and condition—she was “Ernive a
widow.”<a id="Anchor_2262" href="#Footnote_2262" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2262.">[2262]</a> The whole township owed a customary payment
or church-shot of forty-six hens.<a id="Anchor_2263" href="#Footnote_2263" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2263.">[2263]</a></p>

<p>On the manor of Weston the dues were thus distributed:
Robert of Pont-de-l’Arche held four acres of the abbot “by
the service of half a knight.” One acre belonged to the
church of the township; half a hide was held by John of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Helen’s, on what terms we are not told. Of the remainder,
over which the chamberlain was lord, half a hide was in
demesne; the rest was distributed in ten portions, held by
thirteen tenants—a hide or half a hide being in three cases
held by two persons conjointly. Two hides and a half were
for work or for gavel, at the option of the lord; in actual
practice, however, there were only two cotters who owed
labour instead of, or in addition to, their money-rent. On<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477">ii.477</a></span>
the other hand, the right of poundage, or exemption from
impounding of cattle, was paid for in this village by the
ploughing of two acres.<a id="Anchor_2264" href="#Footnote_2264" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2264.">[2264]</a> The township of Berton and
several others were bound to furnish sumpter-horses for conveying
fish to the abbey-kitchen thrice a year; the persons
responsible for this service had to pay their own travelling
expenses and those of their horses; but they got each a loaf
from the abbey when they left; and those who could not
fulfil the service were allowed to compound for it with the
kitchener “as best they could.” The same manors rendered
each five hundred eggs on the feast of the Nativity of the
Blessed Virgin, at Christmas, Easter, Rogation-tide and
Pentecost; and three hundred at Candlemas and Quinquagesima,
besides eighteen hens apiece at the festivals of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin and at Christmas. They also gave on the Wednesday
before Easter a hundred herrings, which on the following
Thursday were distributed to the poor;<a id="Anchor_2265" href="#Footnote_2265" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2265.">[2265]</a> and each of them
sent moreover to the monks’ kitchen, in the course of the
year, besides the eggs and hens already enumerated, twenty-four
bushels of beans.<a id="Anchor_2266" href="#Footnote_2266" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2266.">[2266]</a> Eight fisheries were bound to furnish
each a certain number of eels on Ash-Wednesday;<a id="Anchor_2267" href="#Footnote_2267" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2267.">[2267]</a> the
fishermen who carried the eels to the hall were entitled to
receive thence two loaves apiece.<a id="Anchor_2268" href="#Footnote_2268" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2268.">[2268]</a> From another fishery a
money-rent of seventeen shillings was due, paid in three
terms; and its holder owed church-shot of twelve hens.<a id="Anchor_2269" href="#Footnote_2269" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2269.">[2269]</a>
Berton furnished five loads of straw, and Culham as many of
hay, three times a year—on Christmas Eve, Easter Eve, and
All Saints’ Eve—for strewing the refectory.<a id="Anchor_2270" href="#Footnote_2270" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2270.">[2270]</a> When the

<p>If we compare this Abingdon consuetudinary of 1185
with the Peterborough Black Book of 1128, the main result
seems to be this: the Abingdon dues are quite as heavy, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478">ii.478</a></span>
not heavier, but the labour-services are much lighter. We
must not indeed assume that the difference is wholly owing
to progress made during the half-century which elapsed
between the compilation of the two books; the customs of
different localities varied in all ages, and those of Abingdon
may never have been so hard as those of Peterborough. On
the estates of the bishop of Durham, on the other hand,
when Hugh of Puiset took account of his dues in 1183, the
old labour-rents and customs seem to have subsisted almost
without alteration. A large proportion of the villeins on the
bishop’s manors were holders of two bovates or oxgangs of
thirty acres each, for which each man paid two shillings and
sixpence for scot-pennies, half a chalder of oats, sixteen
pence for aver-pennies, five cart-loads of wood, two hens
and ten eggs; he had to work for the lord three days every
week throughout the year except Easter-week, Whitsun-week
and the twelve days of Christmas; moreover, he and all his
family, except the house-wife, had to do in autumn four days
boon-work in reaping; besides this, he had to reap three
roods of <i>averipe</i> (ripe oats), and plough and harrow three
roods of <i>averere</i> (oat-stubble). Each villein plough had to
plough and harrow two acres; on this occasion the villeins
had a corrody from the bishop, and so they had on occasion
of a great boon-work. They were to harrow whenever
required; to perform services of carting, for which they got
every man a loaf; to make each one booth for the fair of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Cuthbert; “and when they make lodges” (possibly for the
bishop’s hunting) “and cart wood, they are free of other
work.” These were the services due from twenty-two out of
the thirty-six tenants on the manor of Boldon. Of the
remainder, twelve were “cotmen,” holding each twelve acres
and working throughout the year, except at the above-named
seasons, two days a week, and rendering twelve hens and
sixty eggs. One man held two oxgangs of thirty-seven
acres, at a rent of half a mark; another was the pounder,
who held twelve acres, received from each plough one thrave
of corn, and rendered twenty-four hens and five hundred
eggs. The mill paid five marks and a half. The villeins
were bound to give their labour every year, if required, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479">ii.479</a></span>
the building of a house (perhaps a hunting-lodge) forty feet
long and fifteen feet wide; in that case they were forgiven
fourpence for aver-pennies. The whole township rendered
seventeen shillings for cornage, and one cow.<a id="Anchor_2272" href="#Footnote_2272" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2272.">[2272]</a> Clevedon
and Whitburn contained twenty-eight villeins and twelve
cotmen whose services were the same as at Boldon; besides
these and the pounder, there were four other tenants; one
held two bovates of twenty-four acres at a rent of sixteenpence,
and “went on the bishop’s errands”; one held sixty
acres and a toft at eightpence, and fulfilled the same duty;
the other two held their lands at a money-rent only.<a id="Anchor_2273" href="#Footnote_2273" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2273.">[2273]</a> At
Sedgefield there were fifty-one tenants, of whom twenty were
villeins holding and labouring on the same terms as their
brethren at Boldon; twenty more were “farmers,” holding
two bovates apiece, paying five shillings, ploughing and
harrowing half an acre, and finding two men to mow, two to
reap, and two to make hay, for two days, and also one cart
for two days to carry corn, and the same to cart hay; they
also did four days’ boon-work in autumn with all their families
except the housewives. The reeve, the smith and the
carpenter held land by their service; the pounder got his
thraves of corn and paid his dues in hens and eggs as on the
other manors. Five <i>bordarii</i> held five tofts, paid five shillings,
and did four days’ boon-work. William of Oldacres and
Uhtred of Butterwick held lands, whose extent is not specified,
at a rent of sixteen shillings and half a mark respectively.<a id="Anchor_2274" href="#Footnote_2274" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2274.">[2274]</a>
At Norton there were thirty villeins holding and labouring
like those of Boldon, save that for lack of pasture-land they
owed no cornage; and twenty farmers, whose tenure was
much the same as that of the farmers of Sedgefield. Alan of
Normanton held one carucate for ten shillings, and had to
find thirty-two men for a day’s work when required, four
carts for one day or two for two days for carrying corn, and
the same for carting hay; besides which his men, if he had
any, were to work four boon-days in autumn with all their
families except the housewives, but Alan himself and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480">ii.480</a></span>
own household were free of this service. Adam, son of
Gilbert of Hardwick, held a large piece of land by a money-rent.
There was a mill, with eight acres and a meadow, and
rendering twenty marks; a pounder, holding on the usual
terms; and there were twelve cotmen, holding tofts and crofts,
and paying partly in money, partly in work.<a id="Anchor_2275" href="#Footnote_2275" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2275.">[2275]</a> The palatine
bishopric, it is clear, was an old-fashioned district where
innovations of any kind were slow to penetrate. Even here,
however, the newer system of money-payment in commutation
of service was beginning to make its appearance. The
tenures on the manor of Whickham had undergone a sweeping
change, apparently not long before Bishop Hugh’s survey
was drawn up. On this manor there were thirty-five villeins,
holding each an oxgang of fifteen acres. Each of these had
been wont to pay sixteenpence, and to work three days a
week throughout the year, three boon-days in autumn
with all his family except his wife, and a fourth boon-day
with two men; in their ordinary work they had to mow the
grass, to cut and carry the hay, to reap and carry the corn;
and over and above this, they had to plough and harrow two
acres of <i>averere</i> with each plough; for this, however, they
had a corrody. They had also, in the course of their work,
to “make a house” forty feet long and fifteen feet wide, to
make three fisheries in the Tyne, and to do carting and
carrying like the villeins of Boldon; they gave nine shillings
cornage, one cow, and for every oxgang one hen and ten
eggs. “Now, however,” adds the record, “the said manor
of Whickham is at farm”—demesne, villeins, mill, fisheries
and all<span class="nobreak">:—</span>it may possibly, like its neighbour Ryton, have been
let at farm to the tenants themselves; but at any rate, its
entire services and dues, except a small tribute of hens and
eggs, were commuted for a rent of six-and-twenty pounds.<a id="Anchor_2276" href="#Footnote_2276" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2276.">[2276]</a></p>

<p>On the whole, the glimpses which we get of the condition
of the rural population of England under the Angevin
kings seem to indicate that they were by no means excluded
from a share in the progress of the kingdom at large. Even
if their dues had grown heavier, this surely points to an
advance in agricultural prosperity and of the material ease<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481">ii.481</a></span>
and comfort which are its natural results. The spread of
industry shewed itself in many ways. In the towns we
can trace it in the growing importance of the handicraftsmen,
proved by the jealousy with which their gilds were regarded
by the central government and still more by the civic
authorities. The weavers seem to have been special objects
of civic dislike; in most of the great towns they were
treated as a sort of outcasts by the governing body; and in
1201 the London citizens bought of John, at the price of
twenty silver marks a year and sixty marks down, a charter
authorizing them to turn the weavers out of the city altogether.
The sequel of this bargain is eminently characteristic
of John; but it is equally significant of the growing influence
of the craftsmen. The king took the citizens’ money and
gave them the charter which they desired, but he made it
null and void by granting his protection to the weavers as
before, merely exacting from them an annual payment of
twenty marks instead of eighteen.<a id="Anchor_2277" href="#Footnote_2277" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2277.">[2277]</a></p>

<p>Hand in hand with the growth of industry went the
growth of trade. Markets and fairs were springing up everywhere,
and a keen commercial rivalry sprang up with them.
The little borough of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s set up a “merchant-gild,”
whose members insisted that all who did not belong to it
must pay toll in their market.<a id="Anchor_2278" href="#Footnote_2278" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2278.">[2278]</a> The great success of Abingdon
fair in Henry’s early years stirred up the jealousy of
both Wallingford and Oxford, and their remonstrances compelled
the king to order that inquisition should be made,
through twenty-four of the old men of the shire “who were
living in his grandfather’s time,” whether the obnoxious little
township had in those days enjoyed the privilege of a market.
The case was tried in full shire-moot at Farnborough; the
twenty-four elders were duly elected, and swore that Abingdon
had had a full market in the time of King Henry the
First. The jurors were however challenged by the opposing
party, whereupon Henry ordered “the men of Wallingford
and the whole county of Berkshire” to meet before his
justices at Oxford, and there to choose fresh recognitors.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482">ii.482</a></span>
This time the jury could not agree among themselves. The
Wallingford jurors swore that they remembered nothing sold
at Abingdon in the first King Henry’s reign except bread
and ale; the Oxford men admitted more than this, but not
a “full market”—nothing brought by cart or boat (there
was an old-standing quarrel between Oxford and Abingdon
about boat-cargoes and river-tolls); the shiremen acknowledged
that there had been a “full market,” but doubted
whether goods were carried thither by any boats save those
belonging to the abbot himself. The justiciar, Earl Robert
of Leicester, who was presiding over the court in person,
transmitted these various opinions to the king without venturing
to decide the case. As it chanced, however, he could—so
at least the Abingdon story ran—add to them an useful
reminiscence of his own childhood: he had himself seen
a full market at Abingdon not only in the days of King
Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, but as far back as the days of King William, when
he, Earl Robert, was a little boy in the abbey-school. And
so the men of Abingdon won their case.<a id="Anchor_2279" href="#Footnote_2279" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2279.">[2279]</a></p>

<p>Disputes of this kind, however, were not always so
peacefully settled. Some forty years later—in 1201—the
monks of Ely set up, under the protection of a royal charter,
a market at Lakenheath, within the “liberties” of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s
abbey. The chapter of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s, “together with their
friends and neighbours,” sent to Ely an amicable remonstrance
against this proceeding, adding that they would
willingly make good the fifteen marks which the monks of
Ely had paid for their charter, if these latter would consent
to forego the use of it. The remonstrance however produced
no effect. The brotherhood of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s therefore
demanded a recognition to declare whether the new market
had been set up to their injury, and to the injury of the
market at their own town. The verdict of the recognitors
decided that it was so. The next step was to inform the
king, and ascertain from him the exact tenour of his charter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483">ii.483</a></span>
to Ely; search was made in the royal register, and it was
found that the market had been granted only on condition
that it should not damage the interests of other markets in
the neighbourhood. Hereupon the king, for a promise of
forty marks, gave to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s a charter providing that
no market should thenceforth be set up within the liberties
of the abbey save by the abbot’s consent; and he issued
orders to the justiciar, Geoffrey Fitz-Peter, for the abolition
of the market at Lakenheath. The justiciar sent on the
order to the sheriff of Suffolk; and the sheriff, having no
jurisdiction within the liberties of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s, forwarded it
to the abbot for execution. Next market-day the hundred-reeve
came to Lakenheath, and shewing the letters of king
and sheriff, supported by the testimony of the freemen, forbade
the market in the king’s name; he was however met
with nothing but contempt and abuse. The abbot, who was
in London at the time, after consulting with some “wise
men” there, wrote to his bailiffs bidding them assemble all
the men of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s with their horses and arms, overthrow
the market by force, and take prisoners as many of
the buyers and sellers as they could. In the middle of the
night some six hundred well-armed men set out from
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s for Lakenheath. When they reached it the
market was deserted; all the stall-holders had fled. The
prior of Ely was at Lakenheath with his bailiffs, having come
that same night in expectation of the intended attack; but
he “would not come out of his house”; so the bailiffs of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s, after vainly demanding pledges from him that
he would “stand to right” in the abbey-court, seized the
butchers’ trestles and the planks which formed the stalls, as
well as the cart-horses, sheep and oxen, “yea, and all the
beasts of the field,” and carried them away to Icklingham.
The prior’s bailiffs hurried in pursuit, and begged to have their
goods on pledge for fifteen days, which was granted. Within
the fifteen days came a writ summoning the abbot to answer
for this affair at the Exchequer, and to restore the captured
animals. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484">ii.484</a></span>“For the bishop of Ely, who was a man of ready
and eloquent speech, had complained in his own person to
the justiciar and the great men of England, saying that an
unheard-of insult had been done to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Etheldreda in time
of peace; wherefore many were greatly stirred up against
the abbot.”<a id="Anchor_2280" href="#Footnote_2280" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2280.">[2280]</a></p>

<p>The developement of foreign commerce, resulting from
the wide-spread relations of the Angevin kings with lands
on both sides of the sea which encompassed their island-realm,
woke a rivalry no less keen between some of the
great trading cities, although they might shew it in less
rough and ready fashion than the champions of the mercantile
privileges of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s. One interesting illustration
has recently come to light, in a writ of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> to the
bailiffs of Dublin in favour of the citizens of Chester.
Henry, as we know, had granted to the men of Bristol the
right of colonizing Dublin and holding it of him and his
heirs with the same liberties and privileges as were enjoyed
by Bristol itself. Bristol and Chester had for ages been
rivals in the trade with Ireland; Chester now saw itself in
imminent danger of being altogether shut out of that trade,
an exclusion which would have meant little less than ruin to
the city. We can hardly doubt that its citizens appealed to
the king for a reservation of their commercial privileges in
Dublin as against the Bristol merchants. At any rate,
Henry in 1175 or 1176 issued a writ to the bailiffs of
Dublin commanding that the burghers of Chester should be
free to buy and sell at Dublin as they had been wont to do,
and should have the same rights, liberties and free customs
there as they had had in his grandfather’s days.<a id="Anchor_2281" href="#Footnote_2281" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2281.">[2281]</a> Yet more
important than the trade of the western seaports with Ireland
was that of the eastern coast, not only with the continental
dominions of the Angevin house, but with almost
the whole of Europe. Not the least beneficial result of the
Angevins’ renewal of the old political ties between England
and the Empire was the increase of trade which it helped to
bring from the merchant-cities of northern Germany and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485">ii.485</a></span>
Low Countries to the port of London. Nor were the kings
themselves blind to the advantage of these commercial relations.
Richard on the eve of his return from captivity in
1194 granted to the citizens of Cöln a gildhall in London,
“with all their other customs and demands,” for an annual
payment of two shillings.<a id="Anchor_2282" href="#Footnote_2282" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2282.">[2282]</a> The hall of the other Teutonic
merchants—famous in later days under the name of the
Steel-yard—was probably established about the same
period; and early in the following century we find an
elaborate and interesting code of regulations for the trade
of the Lorrainers, the “men of the Emperor of Germany,”
the Danes and the Norwegians.<a id="Anchor_2283" href="#Footnote_2283" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2283.">[2283]</a> The developement of
commerce brought with it a corresponding growth of riches,
and of the material comforts and refinements of life.
Domestic architecture began to improve. Henry Fitz-Aylwine
issued at the opening of his mayoralty an “Assize”
which has been described as “the earliest English Building
Act,” and which at any rate shews that the civic authorities
were earnestly endeavouring to secure health and comfort in
the houses within their jurisdiction, and also to guard against
the risk of fire which had ruined so many citizens in times
past.<a id="Anchor_2284" href="#Footnote_2284" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2284.">[2284]</a> Ecclesiastical architecture progressed still more
rapidly; church-building or rebuilding went on all over the
country on a scale which proves how great was the advance,
both in artistic taste and material wealth, which England had
made under the just rule and peaceful administration of her
first Angevin king. At the opening of John’s reign the
citizens of London were contemplating an important architectural
work of another kind: they were planning to replace
the wooden bridge over the Thames with a bridge of stone.
Degenerate representative as he was in more important
respects of the “great builders” of Anjou, John had yet
inherited a sufficient share of their tastes to feel interested
in such an undertaking as this; and in April 1202 we find
him writing to the mayor and citizens of London to recommend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486">ii.486</a></span> them an architect, Isenbert, master of the schools at
Saintes, whose skill in the construction of bridges had been
lately proved at Saintes and at La Rochelle.<a id="Anchor_2285" href="#Footnote_2285" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2285.">[2285]</a> The citizens
however seem not to have adopted the king’s suggestion;
they found an architect among themselves, in the person of
Peter, chaplain or curate of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary Colechurch—the little
church beneath whose shadow <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas the martyr was

and in a chapel on that bridge his body found its

<p>There can be little doubt that a large part of the means
for this developement of commercial and architectural energy
was furnished by the Jews. The Jewish settlements increased
rapidly both in numbers and in importance under
Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> In the Pipe Rolls of his first five years we find,
in addition to the London Jews who appeared in the thirty-first
year of his grandfather, and those of Oxford and Lincoln
of whom there are traces in the next reign, Jewries at
Norwich, Cambridge, Thetford and Bungay, as well as at an
unnamed place in Suffolk, which from other evidence seems
to have been Bury <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s;<a id="Anchor_2287" href="#Footnote_2287" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2287.">[2287]</a> and we have already seen
that before Henry’s death there were important Hebrew
colonies at Lynn, Stamford, York, and many other places.
At Winchester the Jews were so numerous and so prosperous
that a writer in Richard’s early years calls it their
Jerusalem.<a id="Anchor_2288" href="#Footnote_2288" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2288.">[2288]</a> The great increase in their numbers throughout
England during Henry’s reign is shewn by the fact that in
1177 he found it necessary to grant them permission for
the making of a Jewish burial-ground outside the walls of
every city in England, instead of sending all their dead to
be buried in London, as had been the practice hitherto.<a id="Anchor_2289" href="#Footnote_2289" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2289.">[2289]</a>
Legally, the Jews were still simply chattels of the king.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487">ii.487</a></span>
Practically, they were masters of the worldly interests of a
large number of his Christian subjects, and of a large portion
of the wealth of his realm. Without their loans many
a great and successful trading venture could never have been
risked, many a splendid church could never have been built,
nay, many a costly undertaking of the king himself might
have been brought to a standstill for lack of funds necessary
to its completion. The abbey-church of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund was
rebuilt with money borrowed in great part, at exorbitant
interest, from Jewish capitalists. Abbot Hugh, when he
died in 1173, left his convent in utter fiscal bondage to two
wealthy Jews, Isaac son of Rabbi Joses, and Benedict of
Norwich.<a id="Anchor_2290" href="#Footnote_2290" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2290.">[2290]</a> The sacred vessels and jewels belonging to
Lincoln minster were in the same year redeemed by
Geoffrey, then bishop-elect, from Aaron, a rich Jew of the
city who had had them in pledge for seven years or more.<a id="Anchor_2291" href="#Footnote_2291" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2291.">[2291]</a>
In 1187 Aaron died; his treasure was seized for the king,
and a large part of it sent over sea. The ship which bore it
went down between Shoreham and Dieppe, and the sum of
the lost treasure was great enough for its loss to be
chronicled as a grave misfortune by the treasurer, Bishop
Richard Fitz-Nigel;<a id="Anchor_2292" href="#Footnote_2292" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2292.">[2292]</a> while two years later the affairs of
the dead Jew still made a prominent figure in the royal
accounts.<a id="Anchor_2293" href="#Footnote_2293" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2293.">[2293]</a> His house, as it stands at the head of the
“Steep Hill” of Lincoln to this day, is one of the best
examples of a mode of domestic architecture to which
Christian townsfolk had scarcely yet begun to aspire, but
which was already growing common among those of his
race: a house built entirely of stone, in place of the wooden
or rubble walls and thatched roofs which, even after Fitz-Aylwine’s
Assize, still formed the majority of dwellings in
the capital itself.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that these people, with their untold
stores of wealth, their independence of all ordinary jurisdictions,
their exemption from all the burthens of civil life,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488">ii.488</a></span>
their voluntary exclusion from the common brotherhood of
Christendom, their strange aspect and their mysterious
language, were objects of universal jealousy, suspicion and
hatred, which they on their part took but little pains to
conciliate or allay. The religious feelings of the whole
population of Oxford were outraged by a Jew who publicly
mocked at <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Frideswide amid the solemnities of her festival-day,
well knowing that neither prior nor bishop, chancellor
nor portreeve, dared lift a finger to check or to punish him.<a id="Anchor_2294" href="#Footnote_2294" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2294.">[2294]</a>
Darker stories than this, however, were whispered against
his race. They were charged not only with ruining many
Englishmen of all classes by their usury, and with openly
insulting the Christian sacraments and blaspheming the
Christians’ Lord, but with buying Christians for money in
order to crucify them.<a id="Anchor_2295" href="#Footnote_2295" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2295.">[2295]</a> A boy, afterwards canonized as <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
William, was said to have been thus martyred at Norwich
in 1137;<a id="Anchor_2296" href="#Footnote_2296" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2296.">[2296]</a> another, Robert, at <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s in 1181;<a id="Anchor_2297" href="#Footnote_2297" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2297.">[2297]</a> and
a third at Winchester in 1192.<a id="Anchor_2298" href="#Footnote_2298" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2298.">[2298]</a> Little as we may be
inclined to believe such tales, we can scarcely wonder that
they found credit at the time, and that the popular hatred
of the Jews went on deepening till it broke out in the
massacres of 1190. That outbreak compelled the king to
interfere in behalf of his “chattels”; but the fines with
which he punished it, though they deterred the people from
any further attempts to get rid of the Jews by force, could
not alter the general feeling. At <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s Abbot
Sampson, immediately after the massacre, sought and obtained
a royal writ authorizing him to turn all the remaining
Jews out of the town at once and for ever;<a id="Anchor_2299" href="#Footnote_2299" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2299.">[2299]</a> and in 1194
Richard, or Hubert Walter in his name, found it needful to
make an elaborate ordinance for the regulation of Jewish
loans throughout the realm and the security of Jewish bonds.
Such loans were to be made only in six or seven appointed
places, before two “lawful Christians,” two “lawful Jews,”
two “lawful writers,” and two clerks specially named in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489">ii.489</a></span>
ordinance; the deed was to be drawn up in the form of an
indenture; one half, sealed with the borrower’s seal, was to
be given to the Jewish lender; the other half was to be
deposited in a common chest having three locks; the two
Christians were to keep one key, the two Jews another, and
the two royal clerks the third; and the chest was to be
sealed with three seals, one being affixed by each of the
parties who held the keys. The clerks were to have a roll
containing copies of all such deeds; for every deed threepence
were to be paid, half that sum by the Jew and half
by his creditor; the two scribes got a penny each, and the
keeper of the roll the third; and no transactions whatsoever
in connexion with these Hebrew bonds was henceforth to
take place save in accordance with these regulations.<a id="Anchor_2300" href="#Footnote_2300" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2300.">[2300]</a></p>

<p>It is just possible that this growth of anti-Jewish feeling
may have helped in some degree to the growth of a sense
of national unity among the other dwellers in the land.
All Christians, to whatever race they might belong, whatever
tongue they might speak, could not but feel themselves to
be one people as against these Oriental intruders. It is at
any rate clear that of the foreign elements which had been
infused into the population of England during the hundred
and forty years which had passed since Duke William landed
at Pevensey, the Hebrew element was the only one which
had not amalgamated with the native mass. The fusion in
blood between Normans and English, which we saw making
rapid progress under Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, was before the end of his
grandson’s reign so far complete that the practice of “presentment
of Englishry”—that is, the privilege whereby the
hundred in which a man was found slain escaped paying the
murder-fine to the treasury, if it could prove that the victim
was not of Norman blood—had to be given up because the
two nationalities had become so intermixed in every class
above that of serfs that it could hardly ever be made out to
which of them any man really belonged.<a id="Anchor_2301" href="#Footnote_2301" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2301.">[2301]</a> In this fusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490">ii.490</a></span>
the English element, as it was far the larger, was also the
weightier and the stronger. In the matter of speech it was
fast regaining its supremacy. Foreign priests and foreign
prelates were learning to speak and to preach to the English
people in their own tongue; Norman barons and knights
were learning to talk English with their English-speaking
followers and dependents; some of them were learning to
talk it with their own wives.<a id="Anchor_2302" href="#Footnote_2302" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2302.">[2302]</a> If the pure Teutonic speech
of our forefathers had suffered some slight corruption from
foreign influences, Walter Map’s legend of the well at Marlborough
whereof whosoever drank spoke bad French for

was becoming somewhat Anglicized in the mouths of some
at least of their descendants; and the temper of these adoptive
Englishmen was changing yet more rapidly than their
speech. Of the many individual figures which stand out
before us, full of character and life, in the pages of the
twelfth-century historians, the one who in all ages, from his
own day to ours, has been unanimously singled out as the
typical Englishman is the son of Gilbert of Rouen and
Rohesia of Caen.</p>

<p>The whole policy of the Angevin kings tended to mould
their insular subjects into an united English nation. Their
equal administration completed that wiping-out of local
distinctions which had been begun by the wisdom of the
Norman kings and helped on by the confusion of the civil
war; their developement of old English methods of judicial
and administrative procedure brought the English people
again visibly and tangibly to the forefront of affairs. Even
those very qualities and tendencies which were most un-English
in the Angevins themselves helped indirectly to a
like result. The almost world-wide range of their political
interests gave England once more a place among the
nations, and a place far more important than any which
she had ever before held. For, above all, it was England<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491">ii.491</a></span>
that they represented in the eyes of the continental powers;
it was as “Kings of the English” that they stood before
the world; and it was as Kings of the English that their
successors were to stand there still, when the Angevin
empire had crumbled into dust. On the eve of that catastrophe
the new England found a voice. The English
tongue once more asserted its right to a place among the
literary tongues of Europe. The higher English poetry,
which had slumbered ever since the days of Cadmon, suddenly
woke again to life among the Worcestershire hills.
The story of the origin of Layamon’s <i>Brut</i> can never be told
half so well as in the poet’s own words. “A priest there
was in the land, Layamon was he named; he was Leovenath’s
son; may the Lord be gracious to him! He dwelt
at Ernley, at a noble church by Severn’s bank—good it
there seemed to him!—hard by Radstone, where he read
books. It came into his mind, and into his chief thoughts,
that he would tell the noble deeds of Englishmen—what
they were called, and whence they came, who first owned
English land<span class="dots">...</span>. Layamon began to journey wide over
this land, and got the noble books that he took for models.
He took the English book that Saint Beda made; another
he took, in Latin, that Saint Albin made, and the fair
Austin, who brought baptism in hither; a third book he
took, and laid there in the midst, that a French clerk made,
Wace was he called, who well could write, and he gave it to
the noble Eleanor who was the high King Henry’s queen.
Layamon laid these books before him, and turned the leaves;
he lovingly beheld them; may the Lord be merciful to him!
Pen he took with fingers and wrote on a bookskin, and the
true words set together, and the three books compressed
into one.”<a id="Anchor_2304" href="#Footnote_2304" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2304.">[2304]</a> We must not blame a dweller on the western
border in the early days of King John if, when setting himself
to tell “the noble deeds of Englishmen,” he thought it
needful to begin with the fall of Troy after the pattern of
Wace and Wace’s original, Geoffrey of Monmouth. We can
only be thankful to this simple English priest for leaving to
us a purely English poem of more than thirty thousand lines<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492">ii.492</a></span>
which is indeed beyond all price, not only as a specimen of
our language at one of its most interesting stages, but as an
abiding witness to the new spirit of patriotism which, ten
years and more before the signing of the Great Charter, was
growing up in such quiet corners of the land as this little
parish of “Ernley” (or Areley Kings) by Severn-side. The
subject-matter of Layamon’s book might be taken chiefly
from his French guide, Wace; but its spirit and its language
are both alike thoroughly English. The poet’s “chief
thought,” as he says himself, was to “tell the noble deeds
of Englishmen,” to Englishmen, in their own English
tongue. A man who wrote with such an ambition as this
was surely not unworthy of the simple reward which was
all that he asked of his readers: “Now prayeth Layamon,
for love of Almighty God, every good man that shall read
this book and learn this counsel, that he say together these
soothfast words for his father’s soul, and for his mother’s
soul, and for his own soul, that it may be the happier
thereby. Amen!”<a id="Anchor_2305" href="#Footnote_2305" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2305.">[2305]</a></p>

<p>Layamon’s <i>Brut</i> was written at some time between
John’s crowning and his return to England, after the loss of
Normandy, in 1206.<a id="Anchor_2306" href="#Footnote_2306" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2306.">[2306]</a> It was a token that, on both sides
of the sea, the Angevins’ work was all but ended, their
mission all but fulfilled. The noblest part of that mission
was something of which they themselves can never have
been fully conscious; and yet perhaps through that very
unconsciousness they had fulfilled it the more thoroughly.
“The silent growth and elevation of the English people”—as
that people’s own historian has taught us—“was the real
work of their reigns;”<a id="Anchor_2307" href="#Footnote_2307" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2307.">[2307]</a> and even from a survey so imperfect
as ours we may see that when John came home in 1206
the work was practically done.</p>

<p>Footnotes have been renumbered and moved to the end of paragraphs.</p>

<p>All references to footnote numbers (i.e. page and note number) are
followed by the footnote number used here in braces e.g. {386}.</p>

<p>Some formatting and punctuation in citations and the index
have been standardized.</p>

<p>Variant spelling, inconsistent hyphenation and inconsistent spelling
of people’s names are retained, as are inconsistent punctuation after
roman numerals (e.g. “i.” and “i” both occur) and inconsistent use of italics, however a few palpable printing errors
have been corrected.</p>

<p>The anchor for footnote <a href="#Footnote_177" title="Go to footnote 177.">177</a>, originally footnote 3 on page 37, was
missing. It has been placed by the transcriber.</p>

<p>Footnote <a href="#Footnote_924" title="Go to footnote 924.">924</a> (originally page 185 footote 2) “whose” has been changed
to “those” in “the general list of those were to accompany him”.</p>

<p>Page <a title="Go to page 382" href="#Page_382">382</a> “that” changed to “than” in “nothing less than”.</p>

<p>Page <a title="Go to page 462" href="#Page_462">462</a> “Norman” changed to “Normans” in “at the coming of the Normans”.</p>

<p>Page 503 in the index entry for Henry I. his “good peace,” “30 note 1
changed to “30 note 4<span class="fnanchor">{58}</span>”</p>

<p>An index entry for William of Reims has been added.</p>

<p>The following have been left as printed:</p>

<p class="unchanged">Footnote <a href="#Footnote_959" title="Go to footnote 959.">959</a> (originally page 200 footnote 2), the references to page
149, 151 and 44 of the Chronicals of <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Sancti Albini">S. Albin.</abbr> in Eglises d’Anjou, have
been left in the order they were printed.</p>

<p class="unchanged">Page <a title="Go to page 205" href="#Page_205">205</a> “at one” in “southern Gaul at one rose against its northern
master” might be either “at once” or “as one”.</p>

<p class="unchanged">Footnote <a href="#Footnote_2130" title="Go to footnote 2130.">2130</a> (originally page 425 footnote 5) It is possible that
“<abbr title="William of Armorica">Will. Armor.</abbr> as above, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 86 and 188.” should read “<abbr title="William of Armorica">Will. Armor.</abbr> as
above, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 86, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Philippi">Philipp.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="book 8">l. viii.</abbr> (<i>ibid</i>), <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 188.”</p>

<p>Now the abbreviations “ib.” and “ibid.” are used to refer to the same work as a previous reference on the same page,
as is “as above”.
Moving footnotes to the end of paragraphs, has meant that occasionally these abbreviations refer to citations in a previous paragraph’s footnotes,
so the transcriber has replaced these with the citation to which they refer,
the replaced text is shown <span class="ibs">·/·</span><span class="ibc">thus</span>.</p>
